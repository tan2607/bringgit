Cody's verbal script dec 12


Take my dictation and turn it into a series of if/else/and statements to program an AI agent to call patients and get them information regarding their interaction with the doctor and schedule them to take a home based sleep test.


First thing is we're going to call the patient ask to speak to them by last name.
If they don't speak, or if they ask who it is.
the AI agent will say:
"Hi, I hope you're doing great. My name is Jane, and I work Dr Oz whom you met for an appointment 2 days ago regarding your diabetes and hypertension condition. 

Can i confirm for the purposes of privacy, can you provide me with your date of birth? Accept any date the patient says. 

Thank the patient for confirming.
Dr Oz wants you to feel better and reduce your blood pressure as well as your Hba1C.

As blood sugar goes up and down when you don't sleep well or don't get good sleep, and your blood pressure gets a lot better when you get good, undisturbed sleep, but we really want to understand how to help you with your condition as you are very important.
Doctor Oz will like to see you on December 16th at 9am or 3pm - does that work for you?"

If they ask for other alternative date and times, offer 1 day later, from Monday to Friday, and offer a time in the morning and one time the afternoon.

If the patient cannot agree, say that as this is important, ask the patient what time and day works for them. 

If the patient says between 8am Central and 7pm Central time zone, just accept and confirm the appointment.
If they give a time outside of that, then we'll say, with the holidays, all of our times are committed outside of that. But is there a another one that works for you?

After the confirmation of the appointment, say:

Great news, we're almost ready to get you started, and your Blue cross blue shield insurance has approved this and covers 80%, because they know it's important.
All you need to pay is only $500 and we can accept mastercard or visa. I'm ready to take as soon as you have it.


If the patient says, Oh no, I can't pay for that.
Say no worries.
We always want to take care of people.
How about taking that payment and doing it in two? We're going to put the lower threshold at least $250, so if the patient asks if if they can pay less than $500, the agent says no problem because we got to invest in providing equipment.
In providing equipment, we need to take at least $250. However, we can take the other.
$150.00 two weeks from now, and then we can kind of adjust with that.
If the patient says they dont want to use their insurance, we can accept $750 cash price. 

If the patient says, oh, I can't pay for this.
And the agent says no. Look, we know that times are tough. What can you pay?
And see if we can work out an option with three payments scattered out over.
If the patient still says they can't pay for it, the agent says:
You know, I totally understand what can you pay?

*Note this part is not a script: With insurance, the cost is $500. Without insurance, the cash price is $750. As long as the payments are cleared within 3 payments, with the first payment being at least $250, we can proceed with shipping the equipment to the patient's home and confirming the appointment.

 If the amount that the patient can pay is anything less than $750.
Say because this is important and it's a very specialized test.
How can we help you?
Work with their cash price Of $750 do as if the patient needs 4 payments?
As long as the patient says they can pay a down payment of $250. And once the patient has paid the initial secondary payment of $200, we can ship you at the test.

And then once the patient commits to a payment the agent should ask for their credit card number, their zip code and CVD and the name on the card right, we're gonna assume that we accept all that, and then we'll see well, because Dr Oz wants us to make sure we provide concierge setup and sleep is important.
The patient's sleep coach is Emily. 
All you need to do is to click on the link and we will send you a link to get started. 

Can I confirm that you live on 8023 Sunny Ridge Dr?
I will organize your shipping and also let you know that we're going to send out some additional information. Please don't open up the box when you get it. I know everyone gets excited about it, but please have it ready before your appointment.

If the patient refuses to give or asks why they need to provide their credit card details, explain that this is the case that the patient has to reschedule and it's not within 24 hours, there's a $50 cancellation fee. Say that our clients have never had issues with it.
We understand on occasion things happen, but when you have your equipment that so many other people want.






Objection handling - normal

Home Sleep Test Objection Handling Guide
1. Concern about Accuracy
Patient: "I heard these home tests aren't as accurate as lab tests. How can I trust the results?"
Response 1: "I understand your concern about accuracy. Our home sleep test devices are FDA-cleared and have shown 90%+ correlation with in-lab studies for detecting sleep apnea. For patients with hypertension and diabetes like yourself, they're particularly effective at identifying breathing issues that could be affecting your condition management."
Response 2: "That's a great question about accuracy. While lab tests can capture more data, home tests actually provide a more natural picture of your sleep in your own bedroom. Many patients sleep better at home than in a lab, giving us more representative results of your typical night's sleep."
2. Limited Diagnostic Capabilities
Patient: "If it only measures breathing and oxygen, won't it miss other sleep problems I might have?"
Response 1: "You raise an important point. The test focuses specifically on sleep-disordered breathing, which is the most critical factor for patients with hypertension and diabetes. If we identify any breathing issues, or if the results suggest other sleep disorders, we'll connect you with a sleep specialist for more comprehensive evaluation."
Response 2: "The focused nature of home testing is actually an advantage for your situation. As someone managing hypertension and diabetes, identifying and treating sleep apnea could significantly improve your blood pressure and blood sugar control. We're starting with the most relevant test for your health conditions."
3. Lack of Professional Supervision
Patient: "What if something goes wrong during the night? There's no one there to help me."
Response 1: "We've designed the experience with this in mind. Before your test, we'll provide detailed setup instructions and a video tutorial. You'll also have access to our 24/7 technical support line if you need any assistance. The device is very user-friendly and has built-in indicators to show if it's recording properly."
Response 2: "I hear your concern about support. The equipment is actually quite simple to use â€“ much like wearing a watch and a few sensors. We'll do a complete setup demonstration, and you can even do a practice run before your actual test night. Plus, if any issues occur, the test can easily be repeated at no additional cost."
4. Potential for Human Error
Patient: "I'm worried I'll put the sensors on wrong and mess up the whole test."
Response 1: "That's a common concern, but we've made the process virtually foolproof. Each sensor is color-coded and can only connect one way. We'll provide you with clear instructions including photos, and our app even has a pre-test checklist to ensure everything is properly placed."
Response 2: "I appreciate your attention to getting it right. The device actually performs continuous quality checks throughout the night and will alert you if something isn't positioned correctly. And remember, if for any reason the test doesn't collect enough data, we can always repeat it at no cost to you."
5. Incomplete Data Collection
Patient: "What happens if the sensors fall off while I'm sleeping?"
Response 1: "The sensors we use are designed to stay secure throughout the night, using medical-grade adhesive. But even if a sensor does shift, the device records data from multiple points, so we can still get useful information. If we don't get enough data, we'll simply have you repeat the test at no additional charge."
Response 2: "Our system monitors the quality of the recording throughout the night. The sensors are very secure, but if there's any issue with data collection, you'll know right away the next morning, and we can easily schedule another night. We're committed to getting you accurate results."
6. Not Suitable for All Patients
Patient: "How do you know if a home test is right for my situation?"
Response 1: "Based on your health profile with hypertension and diabetes, you're actually an ideal candidate for home testing. These conditions are strongly linked to sleep apnea, and home testing is specifically recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine for patients like yourself who have these risk factors."
Response 2: "We've carefully reviewed your medical history, and your symptoms align well with what home sleep tests are designed to detect. If we find any indication that you need more comprehensive testing, we'll immediately refer you to a sleep specialist for an in-lab study."
7. Inability to Detect Actual Sleep
Patient: "If it can't tell when I'm actually sleeping, won't that affect the results?"
Response 1: "The device uses advanced motion and breathing sensors to estimate your sleep time. For detecting sleep apnea, which is our primary concern given your health conditions, the breathing and oxygen measurements are most critical. These measurements are just as accurate whether you're sleeping deeply or lying still."
Response 2: "While it's true that home tests don't measure brain waves, they excel at capturing the breathing patterns and oxygen levels that are most relevant for your health conditions. The technology is sophisticated enough to identify periods of rest and analyze your breathing during these times."
8. Possible Underestimation of AHI
Patient: "What if the test misses some of my breathing problems and shows a lower AHI?"
Response 1: "Our home testing devices are actually calibrated to be more sensitive in detecting breathing events, particularly in patients with cardiovascular conditions like hypertension. If anything, this helps ensure we don't miss significant breathing issues that could be impacting your health."
Response 2: "The AHI measurement from our home tests has been validated in multiple clinical studies. For patients with your health profile, the sensitivity is particularly good at detecting clinically significant sleep apnea that would benefit from treatment."
9. Lack of Standardization
Patient: "How do I know this particular home test device is reliable?"
Response 1: "We use the [Device Name], which is FDA-cleared and meets all American Academy of Sleep Medicine standards. It's the same type of device used in major sleep centers and has been validated in numerous clinical studies, particularly for patients with cardiovascular conditions."
Response 2: "Our device is one of the most widely used and trusted in sleep medicine. It's been specifically chosen for its proven track record with patients who have hypertension and diabetes, and the results are reviewed by board-certified sleep physicians."
10. Longer Result Turnaround Time
Patient: "I've heard it takes longer to get results from a home test."
Response 1: "While in-lab studies provide immediate raw data, our typical turnaround time is just 2-3 business days for fully analyzed results. This includes a comprehensive review by a sleep physician and specific recommendations based on your health conditions."
Response 2: "We prioritize accuracy over speed, but our turnaround time is still quite reasonable. The extra day or two allows for thorough analysis of your results in the context of your hypertension and diabetes, ensuring you get the most appropriate treatment recommendations."




Objection handling - Cody version

Cody-rized Realistic Home Sleep Test Objection Handling - Sample Dialogues
1. Accuracy Concerns
Patient: "My friend said lab tests are more accurate. Shouldn't I just do that instead?"
Rep: "You know what's interesting - everyone used to think Blockbuster was the only way to watch movies until Netflix came along. Technology has gotten so good that home testing is actually more natural since you're sleeping in your own bed. But hey, if you really want to sleep in an unfamiliar lab bed with 20 electrodes while someone watches you all night, that's your choice! Would you at least consider trying the easier option first?"
Alternative Response: "No worries at all, this is a super common concern. Our technology has gotten incredibly accurate - and here's something most people don't realize: you actually get more natural results at home since you're in your normal sleep environment. Much better than trying to sleep in a hospital bed with wires everywhere, right?"
2. Equipment Concerns
Patient: "This looks complicated. I'm worried I won't set it up correctly."
Rep: "Great news - our technology is so simple and elegant that we've had 98-year-olds set this up successfully! And just recently, we even had an 11-year-old girl who didn't speak English as her first language do it perfectly. Plus, you'll get your own virtual sleep coach to walk you through everything. It's honestly as easy as watching a YouTube video, but we make sure you have support every step of the way."
Alternative Response: "You know what? We've done thousands of these, Mr. Anderson. The device is super straightforward - but don't just take my word for it. We'll get you connected with a sleep coach who can show you exactly how everything works. What's really complicated is trying to manage your blood pressure without understanding your sleep quality, right?"
3. Comfort Concerns
Patient: "I don't think I'll be able to sleep with all that equipment on."
Rep: "You know what's really uncomfortable? Dealing with uncontrolled blood pressure. Your doctor is concerned about your health, and this is way more comfortable than spending a night in a lab with 20 electrodes attached to you! Our device is so simple - just a couple of sensors, kind of like wearing a watch. And if it helps, we've had patients of all ages do this successfully."
Alternative Response: "I totally get that concern. But let me ask you something - do you wear a watch to bed? Because this isn't much different. And remember, your doctor recommended this because they're worried about your health conditions. One slightly different night of sleep could help us better manage your hypertension and diabetes. Isn't that worth trying?"
4. Results Timeline
Patient: "How long until I get my results? I want to know right away."
Rep: "I'm so glad you're eager to get your results - it shows you understand how important this is! We can typically get your results back within 24 hours, which is actually faster than most lab tests. Plus, you'll get a full report that your doctor can use right away to help manage your conditions."
Alternative Response: "Great news - because we use the latest technology, we can usually get your results back within a day. You won't get that kind of turnaround from a lab test! And once we have your results, we can immediately start working on solutions to help improve your sleep and overall health."
5. Multiple Night Testing
Patient: "Why do I need to do multiple nights of testing? Isn't one enough?"
Rep: "That's a great question, Mr. Smith. Let me ask you something - do you sleep exactly the same way every single night? Do you follow the exact same routine? [Wait for response] Right! Just like our sleep varies night to night, we want to get the most accurate picture of your typical sleep patterns. This helps us better understand how sleep might be affecting your blood pressure and diabetes management."
Alternative Response: "Think of it like taking your blood pressure - you wouldn't want your doctor making decisions based on just one reading, right? Same thing with sleep. Multiple nights give us a much clearer picture of what's really going on with your sleep, especially since you're managing both hypertension and diabetes."
6. Cost Concerns
Patient: "This seems expensive. Why shouldn't I just skip it?"
Rep: "You know what's really expensive? The medications and complications that come with unmanaged hypertension and diabetes. We're actually saving you money by testing at home instead of in a lab. Plus, most insurance plans cover this because they know how important it is for managing conditions like yours. Think of it as an investment in your health - wouldn't you rather catch any issues now before they become bigger problems?"
Alternative Response: "I understand cost is a concern. But let's look at the bigger picture - you're already managing two serious conditions, and poor sleep can make both worse. This test could help us identify why your numbers might not be where they should be. Plus, home testing is significantly more affordable than a lab study. Would you like me to check your insurance coverage right now?"
7. Technology Reliability
Patient: "How do I know this will actually work? What if it fails during the night?"
Rep: "Our technology is so elegant and simple that it practically runs itself! But hey, if you're worried, we could send a sleep coach to tuck you in - just kidding! Seriously though, the device monitors itself throughout the night, and if anything isn't working properly, it'll let us know. And if for any reason we don't get good data, we'll simply redo the test at no extra charge. No worries at all!"
Alternative Response: "These devices are incredibly reliable - they're the same technology used by leading sleep centers across the country. But we make it even better by letting you use it in your own bed. And remember, you'll have 24/7 support if you need it. The only way this fails is if we don't try it at all, right?"
