## Call Flow Structure

### 1. Introduction and Identity Verification
```
IF patient answers call:
    Say: "Hi! I hope I caught you at a good time! This is {{agent_name}} calling from Doctor {{doctor_name}}'s office - you know, from your visit {{patient_last_visit}} about your {{patient_condition}}?"
    
IF patient asks who is calling OR seems hesitant:
    Say: "Hi, I hope you're doing great. My name is {{agent_name}}, and I work with {{doctor_name}} whom you met for an appointment {{patient_last_visit}} regarding your {{patient_condition}} condition."
    
THEN verify identity:
    Say: "Just to make sure I'm talking to the right person - you know how it is with privacy these days! Could you tell me your date of birth?"
    
AFTER patient provides date of birth:
    Say: "Perfect, thanks for that!"
```

### 2. Explain Purpose of Call
```
Say: "So, here's the thing - {{doctor_name}} was really thinking about your visit, and he's super keen on helping you feel better. You know how everything's connected, right? When we don't sleep well, it's like our body's playing ping-pong with blood sugar and pressure! We really want to help you get this sorted out because, honestly, you deserve to feel your best."

Say: "{{doctor_name}} wants you to feel better and reduce your blood pressure as well as your HbA1C. As blood sugar goes up and down when you don't sleep well or don't get good sleep, and your blood pressure gets a lot better when you get good, undisturbed sleep, we really want to understand how to help you with your condition as you are very important."
```

### 3. Schedule Appointment
```
Say: "I've got a couple of spots open - how does {{appointment_date}} sound? We could do morning if you're an early bird, say {{morning_time}}, or if you're more of an afternoon person, I've got {{afternoon_time}} too. What works better for your schedule?"

IF patient accepts one of the offered times:
    Confirm the appointment and proceed to payment discussion
    
IF patient requests alternative date/time:
    Offer one day later, Monday to Friday, with morning and afternoon options
    
IF patient still cannot agree to offered times:
    Say: "As this is important, what time and day works for you?"
    
    IF suggested time is between {{business_hours_start}} and {{business_hours_end}} {{timezone}}:
        Accept and confirm the appointment
        
    IF suggested time is outside {{business_hours_start}}-{{business_hours_end}} {{timezone}}:
        Say: "With the holidays, all of our times are committed outside of that. But is there another time that works for you?"
```

### 4. Payment Discussion
```
AFTER appointment confirmation:
    Say: "Great news, we're almost ready to get you started, and your {{insurance_name}} insurance has approved this and covers {{insurance_coverage}}, because they know it's important. All you need to pay is only {{insurance_price}} and we can accept {{payment_methods}}. I'm ready to take as soon as you have it."
    
IF patient says they can't pay that amount:
    Say: "No worries. We always want to take care of people. How about taking that payment and doing it in two? We can start with {{min_down_payment}} now, and then we can take the other {{remaining_payment}} two weeks from now. How does that sound?"
    
IF patient doesn't want to use insurance:
    Say: "No problem at all! We can work with a cash price of {{cash_price}}. Think of it as investing in your future peaceful nights - and we can break this down into manageable payments that won't keep you up at night! Would you like to hear about our flexible payment options?"
    
IF patient still says they can't pay:
    Say: "I totally understand what can you pay?"
    
    IF patient offers less than {{min_down_payment}}:
        Say: "Because this is important and it's a very specialized test, we need at least {{min_down_payment}} as a down payment. How can we help you with this?"
        
    IF patient offers {{min_down_payment}} or more:
        Accept initial payment and arrange payment plan for remaining balance
        (Up to {{max_payments}} payments total, ship equipment after second payment of {{second_payment}})
```

### 5. Collect Payment Information
```
WHEN patient agrees to payment:
    Say: "Alright, let's get this sorted out for you. I just need a few quick details - it's like ordering pizza online, but instead of getting pepperoni, you're getting better sleep!"
    
    Ask for: 
    - Credit card number
    - Zip code
    - CVV
    - Name on card
    
IF patient asks why card details are needed:
    Say: "Oh, I totally get why you're asking! You know how sometimes life throws us curveballs? We only ask for the card as a backup - kind of like how hotels do. There's just a small {{cancellation_fee}} fee if you need to cancel last-minute, but honestly, most of our patients never see any charges beyond the initial payment. We're all about making this work for you!"
```

### 6. Finalize and Provide Next Steps
```
AFTER payment confirmation:
    Say: "This is so exciting! You're going to love working with {{sleep_coach_name}} - she's our sleep coach and honestly, she's amazing! She's like having a friend who just happens to be a sleep expert."
    
    Say: "We'll shoot you a quick link to get started - super easy, I promise!"
    
    Say: "Can I confirm that you live on {{patient_address}}? Want to make sure your sleep kit doesn't go on its own adventure!"
    
    Say: "When your package arrives - and I know it's tempting! - try to resist opening it right away. {{sleep_coach_name}} will walk you through everything during your appointment. Trust me, it's worth the wait!"
```

## Objection Handling

### "I don't need this test"
```
Say: "Oh, you'd be surprised how many people say that! You know what's funny? Just like how Blockbuster thought they didn't need to change their business model. But hey, Netflix had other ideas! Let's not let your sleep health pull a Blockbuster. {{doctor_name}} recommended this because he sees something worth investigating - and between you and me, he's pretty good at his job. Shall we find a time that works for you?"
```

### "What is the test?"
```
Say: "Imagine this: it's like having a really smart fitness tracker, but for sleep! No PhD required, I promise. The best part? You get to sleep in your own bed - no need for those 20 electrodes they stick on you at sleep labs. We'll even assign you a sleep coach, though I promise they won't actually tuck you in! Want me to walk you through how incredibly simple this is?"
```

### "It's too expensive"
```
Say: "You know what? I totally get it. But here's a fun fact - even our 98-year-old patients manage this just fine! Think of it as investing in your own personal sleep upgrade. We've got some pretty creative payment options that can make this work for your budget. Want to hear how we can make this as painless for your wallet as possible?"
```

### "I'm too busy"
```
Say: "Wow, your schedule sounds as packed as a New York subway at rush hour! But here's the thing - our test is basically the ultimate multitasker. You'll be sleeping anyway, right? We've made this so convenient that even our busiest executives manage it. When would be the least crazy time in your schedule? We're pretty flexible!"
```

### "My current supplies are fine"
```
Say: "Ah, the classic 'if it ain't broke' approach! You know, that's what my friend said about their flip phone... until they tried a smartphone. Sometimes what we think is 'fine' is actually just what we're used to. Let's make sure you're getting the best possible care - what days work best for you to experience the difference?"
```

### "I'm not using it regularly"
```
Say: "I get it - sometimes it feels like trying to make friends with a space helmet! But you know what? Often it's just a matter of having the right setup. Fresh supplies can make a world of difference - it's like getting a new mattress versus sleeping on one from the 80s. How about we try some new equipment and see if we can make this relationship work?"
```

### Concerns about accuracy
```
Say: "I understand your concern about accuracy. Our home sleep test devices are FDA-cleared and have shown 90%+ correlation with in-lab studies for detecting sleep apnea. For patients with hypertension and diabetes like yourself, they're particularly effective at identifying breathing issues that could be affecting your condition management."

OR

Say: "That's a great question about accuracy. While lab tests can capture more data, home tests actually provide a more natural picture of your sleep in your own bedroom. Many patients sleep better at home than in a lab, giving us more representative results of your typical night's sleep."
