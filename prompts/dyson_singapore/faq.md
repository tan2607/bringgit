# Dyson Singapore FAQ

## Vacuum Cleaners

### Battery and Power Issues
Q: My Dyson vacuum's battery isn't lasting as long as it used to. What should I do?
A: Firstly, let's check if the battery is properly charged - it typically needs 4-5 hours for a full charge. The runtime varies based on the power mode used. For optimal performance, ensure the filters are clean and there are no blockages. If the issue persists after these checks, I can help schedule a battery health check at our service center.

Q: Why is my vacuum not charging?
A: Let me help you troubleshoot this. First, ensure the charger is properly connected to both the power outlet and the vacuum. Check if the charging dock's LED light is on. If using a wall-mounted dock, verify it's properly installed. Sometimes, cleaning the charging contacts on both the vacuum and dock can resolve charging issues.

### Suction Problems
Q: My vacuum has lost suction power. How can I fix this?
A: Let's go through the most common causes. Firstly, check if the bin needs emptying - it should be cleared when debris reaches the MAX line. Next, inspect and clean both filters according to the user guide. Also, check for any blockages in the wand and cleaning head. If these steps don't help, there might be an internal issue requiring service center attention.

Q: Why is my vacuum making unusual noises?
A: This could indicate a blockage or part that needs attention. First, turn off the vacuum and check for any visible obstructions in the cleaning head, wand, and bin inlet. Remove any tangled hair or debris from the brush bar. If you hear a clicking sound, the brush bar might need cleaning or replacement.

## Air Purifiers and Fans

### Air Quality Monitoring
Q: How do I know if my air purifier is working effectively?
A: Your Dyson air purifier displays real-time air quality information on its LCD screen or through the Dyson Link app. Look for the AQI (Air Quality Index) reading - lower numbers indicate better air quality. The auto mode automatically adjusts purification levels based on detected pollutants.

Q: Why does my air purifier show poor air quality even after running for hours?
A: Several factors could cause this. Check if there are any ongoing sources of pollutants (cooking, cleaning, open windows). Ensure the room size matches the purifier's capacity. The filters might need replacement if they've been used beyond their recommended lifespan (usually 12 months).

### Maintenance
Q: How often should I clean or replace the filters?
A: For optimal performance, HEPA and carbon filters typically need replacement every 12 months based on 12 hours daily usage. The Dyson Link app will notify you when it's time to change filters. However, if you use the purifier more frequently or in heavily polluted areas, earlier replacement might be necessary.

## Hair Care Products

### Product Usage
Q: My Dyson hair dryer is making a loud noise. Is this normal?
A: While Dyson hair dryers are engineered to be powerful, unusual noises might indicate an issue. Check if the filter is clean and properly attached. Ensure the attachments are correctly fitted. If you hear a grinding or rattling noise, please contact our service center as this may require professional attention.

Q: How can I prevent heat damage while using Dyson hair styling products?
A: Dyson hair care products feature intelligent heat control technology. Always start with a lower heat setting and gradually increase if needed. Use the cool shot button to set your style. Keep the device moving while styling and avoid concentrating heat in one area for too long.

## Warranty and Service

### Warranty Coverage
Q: How do I check my warranty status?
A: You can check your warranty status by visiting our website and entering your product's serial number. Alternatively, I can help you check it right now if you have the serial number handy. Most Dyson products come with a 2-year warranty covering parts and labor.

Q: What's covered under the warranty?
A: The warranty covers manufacturing defects in materials and workmanship. This includes motor issues, electrical faults, and structural defects. However, it doesn't cover normal wear and tear, accidental damage, or issues caused by misuse. Consumables like filters are also not covered.

### Service and Repairs
Q: How long does a typical repair take?
A: Most repairs at our service centers are completed within 3-5 working days. Complex repairs might take longer, but we'll keep you updated on the progress. For eligible products, we offer loan units while yours is being repaired.

Q: Do you provide home service for repairs?
A: Currently, we don't offer home repair services in Singapore. However, our service centers at Capitol Singapore and Jewel Changi Airport are conveniently located and offer comprehensive repair services. We recommend booking an appointment in advance to minimize waiting time.
