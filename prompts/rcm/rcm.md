Below is a comprehensive solution plan and an accompanying flowchart that outlines a strategy for semi-automating CARC (Claim Adjustment Reason Code) triage within the Brightree RCM environment. The plan combines data-driven similarity matching, AI (LLM) reasoning, and integration of existing human workflow procedures to generate resolution proposals for denials.

1. Overview

When a claim denial occurs, the system should automatically look back through historical data within Brightree for cases with similar parameters (e.g., patient demographics, CPT codes, NPI, policy coverage, etc.) that were successfully paid. The goal is to pinpoint key differences between the denied claim and successful historical cases. An AI reasoning model (LLM) then uses these insights, along with any established human SOPs, to generate a draft resolution plan. A human then reviews the proposal to decide whether to implement it automatically or to intervene manually.

2. Detailed Solution Plan

A. Data Integration & Extraction
	•	Data Extraction:
	•	Connect to the Brightree system to capture real-time denial events.
	•	Extract key claim details: demographic data, CPT codes, NPI, policy information, denial codes (CARC), and supporting documentation.
	•	Preprocessing:
	•	Normalize and clean data to ensure consistency (e.g., standardizing coding formats, handling missing values).
	•	Engineer features relevant for similarity matching (e.g., weighting criteria by payer guidelines).

B. Similarity Matching & Historical Analysis
	•	Historical Data Search:
	•	Implement a similarity search algorithm that scans historical claims data for records with similar features (demographic, procedural, provider, and coverage data).
	•	Rank the cases by similarity score, ensuring that only those with successful resolution outcomes are selected.
	•	Comparative Analysis:
	•	Compare the denied claim against the top matching successful cases to identify differences.
	•	Highlight discrepancies such as differing modifiers, documentation gaps, or payer-specific nuances that might have led to the denial.

C. AI-Driven Reasoning for Resolution Proposal
	•	Workflow SOP Integration:
	•	If an established human Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) exists for a given denial type, retrieve and incorporate it as a baseline reference.
	•	LLM Reasoning Model:
	•	Input the comparative analysis results and SOP guidelines into an LLM.
	•	Configure the model to generate a step-by-step resolution plan that:
	•	Addresses the identified discrepancies.
	•	Suggests adjustments to documentation or coding.
	•	Recommends payer-specific appeals or resubmission strategies.
	•	Human-in-the-Loop Validation:
	•	Present the AI-generated proposal to a human expert who can validate and refine the plan before final execution.

D. Automation & RPA Integration
	•	Implementation via RPA:
	•	Once the resolution plan is approved, trigger an RPA bot to execute the necessary steps (e.g., updating claim details, generating appeal letters, or interfacing with payer portals).
	•	Monitoring & Feedback:
	•	Log each resolution attempt with detailed metadata.
	•	Monitor outcomes to track success rates and learn from any exceptions.
	•	Update the historical database continuously with outcomes to improve future similarity matching and AI suggestions.

E. Compliance, Exception Handling & Scalability
	•	Compliance:
	•	Ensure all processes adhere to HIPAA and other regulatory guidelines, with secure data handling and audit trails.
	•	Exception Handling:
	•	If no similar case is found or if the AI’s confidence score is below a set threshold, automatically escalate the denial for full manual review.
	•	Scalability:
	•	Design the system modularly so that as new denial codes and scenarios emerge, additional workflows can be incorporated easily.
