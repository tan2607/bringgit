Biologics are genetically engineered proteins. Ustekinumab works by blocking the activity of proteins known as interleukin (IL) 12 and 23.</p>\n<p>IL-12/23 levels are increased in diseases such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. This medication helps to reduce the activity of the immune system and the symptoms of the disease.</p>\n<p>Ustekinumab does not work immediately and it may take several weeks before you notice any improvement in symptoms.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-should-i-takeuse-this-medication\">How should I take/use this medication?</h2>\n<p>Ustekinumab should be taken as prescribed and you should not stop using the medication without discussing it with your doctor. Stopping Ustekinumab abruptly may cause the symptoms of your condition to return.</p>\n<p>It may be taken alone, with methotrexate, or with other disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).</p>\n<p>Ustekinumab is available in a solution for injection that comes in a pre-filled form (ready-to-use). It is given via injection under the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach, thigh or upper outer arm or into the blood vessel (intravenous infusion). You and your doctor will decide if you should administer Ustekinumab yourself. You or your carer should receive training on how to inject the medication from your doctor, pharmacist or specialty nurse prior to attempting administration on your own. Always remember to rotate the injection site.</p>\n<p>Your doctor will decide how much Ustekinumab you need and for how long.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-should-i-do-if-i-forget-to-takeuse-this-medication\">What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?</h2>\n<p>If you miss a dose, inject it as soon as you remember.

You should consult a doctor immediately if you develop a fever or feel unwell.

It is applied onto the skin. It is used to treat menopausal symptoms like hot flushes, excessive sweating, vaginal dryness and bone loss. These symptoms are typically caused by a decrease in the levels of estrogen in the body, which happens naturally after menopause. Topical estrogen works by replacing the estrogen in the body.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Using estrogen alone may cause unusual thickening of the uterus (womb) lining.Hence women who have an intact uterus will require an additional female hormone, progestogen, to prevent this. If your doctor prescribes progestogen to be taken for a specific duration (usually 10 – 14 days) each month, you will experience a withdrawal bleed (menses) after finishing the progestogen capsules/tablets.</div><div><br></div><h2>How should I take/use this medication?</h2><div><ul><li>Do not stop using your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.</li><li>There are two types of topical estrogen available – Oestrogel® and Divigel®.</li><li>The medication should be applied once a day, around the same time each day. </li><li>Before using the medication, clean your skin, wash your hands and allow them to dry thoroughly.</li><li>Oestrogel®:</li><ul><li>The medication comes in a tube, with a graduated measure (ruler).</li><li>Unless otherwise directed by the doctor, start with measuring out ½ ruler (1.25g) of the gel and slowly increase to 1 ruler (2.5g) of the gel. </li></ul><li>Divigel®:</li><ul><li>The medication comes in sachets.</li><li>Open the sachet and squeeze out the contents onto the skin.</li></ul><li>Apply the medication to the skin of the outer upper arms, lower part of the stomach <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">or</span> the right or left thigh.</li><li>The medication should be applied over a large surface, about 1 – 2 times the size of your hand.</li><li><strong>Do not apply the medication to the face, breasts or vaginal area as well as on cuts, scrapes or irritated skin.</strong></li><li>After the application, allow the gel to dry for a few minutes and do not wash the area for at least one hour.

Do not apply two doses to make up for the missed dose.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Sometimes, a missed dose may cause breakthrough bleeding (unexpected bleeding). </div><div><br></div><h2>What precautions should I take?</h2><div>Inform your healthcare professional if:<br></div><div><ul><li>You are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication.</li><li>You are taking any other medications, including supplements, traditional medications and herbal remedies.</li><li>You have unexplained vaginal bleeding.</li><li>You have a history of or current medical conditions such as liver problems, stroke, heart disease, blood clots, migraine headaches, epilepsy (fits), diabetes mellitus, cancer or have unexplained vaginal bleeding.</li><li>You are going for surgery or will be on bed rest.</li></ul></div><div><br></div><h2>What are some common side-effects of this medication?<br></h2><div><ul><li>Breast tenderness</li><li>Headache</li><ul><li>You may take Paracetamol to manage headaches.

Young children may present with less specific symptoms such as irritability, crying, difficulty in waking or refusal to eat.</p>\n<p>Meningococcal disease is spread through direct person-to-person contact (e.g. through saliva during kissing) or when in close and prolonged contact with an infected person through the air (e.g. coughing or sneezing). A person who is well but a carrier of the bacteria in their body, may also spread the disease.</p>\n<p>While the risk of meningococcal disease is rare in most countries, it is a severe disease with a significant risk of death or lasting disabilities in people who get it.</p>\n<h2>Who Should Receive the Meningococcal Vaccine?</h2>\n<p>The meningococcal vaccine is recommended for the prevention of meningococcal disease among high-risk groups such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Persons travelling to Mecca for the Hajj or Umrah (a mandatory requirement by Saudi Arabia’s government)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Persons travelling to the sub-Saharan Africa</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Persons with lower body resistance to infections due to</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Conditions such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, spleen removal or abnormal spleen function, sickle cell disease</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On treatment with medications such as Eculizumab</p>\n</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>\n<p>Persons who are close contacts of patients with meningococcal disease</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Persons at risk due to an outbreak of meningococcal disease in the community</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you think you are among the high-risk groups, please consult your doctor for advice.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-precautions-should-i-follow-before-receiving-the-meningococcal-vaccine\">What Precautions Should I Follow Before Receiving the Meningococcal Vaccine?</h2>\n<p>Inform your healthcare professional if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You are allergic to this vaccine or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You are taking any other medications</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You are currently not feeling well and having a fever</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You have a weak immune system due to an illness such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You are currently on medications which weaken your immune system (e.g. high dose steroids)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You have recently received any other vaccines</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You have a history of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (a rare nerve condition)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You have a history of bleeding disorders</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-is-the-meningococcal-vaccine-given\">How Is The Meningococcal Vaccine Given?</h2>\n<p>It is given by injection into a muscle.</p>\n<p>It is given as a series of one, two or four doses, depending on the age when the first dose was given and whether you have a weak immune system.

The cornea is the front, transparent part of the eye. When fluid builds up within the cornea, the swelling causes clouding of the cornea. This leads to blurry vision, and for some patients, they may also see halos around street lights or car headlights especially at night. Sodium chloride 5% helps to draw out fluid from the cornea to reduce swelling and relieve such symptoms.</p><p>Cornea swelling may occur due to surgery or in cornea disorders such as bullous keratopathy or Fuch’s dystrophy.</p><h2 id=\"how-should-i-takeuse-this-medication\">How should I take/use this medication?</h2><ul><li><p>Proper use of eye drop<br></p></li><ul>\n         \n            <li><p>Click on these links for</p></li>\n            <ul><li><p>\n                  \n                     A step-by-step guide on how to apply eye drops                                   <a href=\"https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/A-Step-By-Step-Guide-On-How-To-Instil-Eye-Drops\">https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/A-Step-By-Step-Guide-On-How-To-Instil-Eye-Drops</a><br><br></p></li><li><p>A step-by-step guide on how to apply eye ointment                                <a href=\"https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/A-Step-by-Step-Guide-on-How-to-Apply-Eye-Ointment\">https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/A-Step-by-Step-Guide-on-How-to-Apply-Eye-Ointment</a><br></p></li></ul></ul></ul><ul>\n      <span style=\"font-size:13px;\">\n         <ul><li><p>\n               If you need to use more than 1 drop of medication, or if you are using another type of eye drop, wait at least 5 to 10 minutes before applying the next eye drop.

VZV is the same virus that causes chickenpox. It stays dormant in your body and can cause shingles later in life. Though shingles cannot spread directly from one person to another, the VZV can spread and cause chickenpox in those who never had chickenpox or had never received the chickenpox vaccine .Transmission of the VZV is through direct contact with fluid from the shingles rash blisters.People with shingles cannot spread the VZV before their rash blisters appear or after the rash has crusted.</div><div><br></div><div>The first symptom of shingles is usually pain, which can be intense with even a slightest touch. Other symptoms of shingles include rash, fluid filled blisters, fever, headache, chills, or stomach upset. </div><div><br></div><div>A common complication of shingles, especially in older adults is a nerve pain, called postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), which can be severe and long-lasting, even after the rash has cleared. Other rare complications include lung infection (pneumonia), brain inflammation (encephalitis), hearing loss or blindness.</div><div><br></div><h2>What Are the Types of Shingles Vaccine Available?</h2><div>There are two types of vaccines available:</div><div><ol><li>Recombinant Shingles Vaccine</li><li>Live Shingles Vaccine </li></ol></div><div>The recombinant shingles vaccine does not contain the live VZV, but contains the shingles “code” for the body to recognise and obtain immunity from.

Ear wax buildup and blockage can happen to one, or both ears.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-the-possible-causes-of-this-condition\">What are the possible causes of this condition?</h2>\n<p>Ear wax is produced inside the ear canal by the glands just under the skin. It is responsible for lubricating the ear canal, preventing dust and bacteria from entering the middle ear. Normal ear wax will move towards the outer part of the ear canal and gets removed naturally from the ears.</p>\n<p>If the ear wax builds up and hardens or becomes firmly lodged in the ear canal, it can cause partial or total blockage.

They are typically used for milder cases where symptoms do not occur frequently or do not last long.</p><p>Some antihistamines are combined with a decongestant which gives additional relief of blocked nose. They should not be used for prolonged periods to manage AR.</p><h3>Steroid Nasal Sprays</h3><p>They are most effective in reducing moderate symptoms associated with AR. They work best when used continuously and the maximum effect is usually seen in 2 weeks.</p><h3>Decongestant Nasal Spray</h3><p>Decongestant sprays are useful in relieving blocked nose. They should be limited to NOT more than 3-5 days due to potential worsening of the symptoms once the medication is stopped.</p><h3>Eyedrops</h3><p>Antihistamine eyedrops provide fast relief of itchy watery eyes.</p><p>Some antihistamine eyedrops are combined with a decongestant to help reduce eye redness. Such preparations should be limited to NOT more than 3-5 days to prevent symptoms from worsening once the medication is stopped.</p><h3>Saline Nasal Wash</h3><p>The nasal washes are a drug-free option to remove allergens and clear blocked nasal passages.</p><p>Isotonic washes are used for cleaning the nose and may be used daily. Hypertonic washes clear blocked nasal passages and used for the short term.</p><h2>How else can I manage allergic rhinitis?</h2><ul><li><p>Avoidance of allergens is the best management once it is identified.</p></li><li><p>Cleaning methods like vacuuming and mopping may be used to keep the house clean, significantly reducing allergies.</p></li><li><p>Control quality of air in the home by using air purifiers that contain HEPA filters. Keep a low humidity and ensure good ventilation to prevent mould formation.</p></li><li><p>Bed sheets should be washed with hot water weekly and allergen-proof sheets used for pillows and mattresses.</p></li><li><p>If there are any pets at home, they should be kept out of the bedroom and off the furniture.</p></li></ul><h2>Do I need to see a doctor?</h2><p>Please consult a doctor when you experience any of the following:</p><ul><li><p>Wheezing and/or shortness of breath</p></li><li><p>Persistent fever (>37.5°C)</p></li><li><p>Signs and symptoms of sinus or ear infection e.g. Yellow/greenish discharge from the nose/ear or sinus/ear pain</p></li><li><p>No improvement after 3 months of continuous usage of steroid nasal sprays</p></li><li><p>Worsening of allergy symptoms despite self-care</p></li><li><p>Severe allergy symptoms that affect your quality of life, persisting past 4 weeks</p></li></ul><h2>Can allergic rhinitis be cured?</h2><p>Children in particular, may outgrow the allergy as the immune system becomes less sensitive to the allergen. However, once exposed to the allergen, allergies tend to have long-term effect on the person. Nevertheless, most cases of AR can be effectively managed.</p><p><img src=\"https://ch-api.healthhub.sg/api/public/content/0b3edaccca594ee6a214e10bc757a8e2?v=9749dcd9\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:5px;\" /> </p><hr /><p style=\"font-size:12px;\"><u>Disclaimer</u></p><p style=\"font-size:12px;\"><em>Information provided by this patient information leaflet is solely for informational purposes only and is not intended as a substitute for the advice provided by your physician, pharmacist or other healthcare professional.

There are five species of <em>Plasmodium</em> and any of these can cause malaria. It spreads to humans commonly through the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito.</p>\n<p>Although uncommon, malaria can also spread through</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Pregnancy: from mother to the unborn child</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Transfusion of blood infected with malaria</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Contact with an infected person’s blood e.g. through sharing of hypodermic needles by drug abusers</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The disease is found most often in tropical countries, particularly in the less developed areas. In some countries, the city areas might be free from malaria while it might be common in other parts of the country.</p>\n<p>The risk of infection for travellers will be different depending on the area within the country they will be travelling to and the types of activities they will be doing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-the-symptoms-of-malaria\">What are the symptoms of malaria?</h2>\n<p>The symptoms of this condition can include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>High fever (more than 38.5⁰C)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Chills with uncontrollable shivering and excessive sweating</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Headache</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Muscle ache</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tiredness or weakness</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Jaundice (yellow eyes and skin) in some cases</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Confusion / coma</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Malaria symptoms can develop as early as 7 days after you first get exposed to the parasite. It can also develop as late as a few months after you leave the area where malaria is present.</p>\n<p>Hence, it is important to know that any illness that happens within one year and especially within three months after you return might be malaria, even if you followed all recommended steps to prevent malaria. If you develop any illness, especially within three months of your return from your trip, you should see a doctor immediately and inform your doctor that you went to a country where malaria is present.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-can-i-take-to-prevent-malaria\">What can I take to prevent malaria?</h2>\n<p>Malaria can be prevented in the following ways and you can approach your pharmacist to get the following medication.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Atovaquone / Proguanil (Malarone®)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Medications to prevent malaria do not offer complete protection and you should still prevent yourself from getting bitten by mosquitoes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-else-can-i-do-to-manage-this-condition\">What else can I do to manage this condition?</h2>\n<p>General protection is the most important step to prevent malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases. As Anopheles mosquitoes are more active at night, the malaria parasite would be passed on to the humans mainly between sunset and sunrise. Therefore, it is important to take steps to reduce contact with mosquitoes, especially during these hours.</p>\n<p>Other than using medications to prevent the condition, malaria can also be prevented by the following methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Wear long-sleeved shirts and long trousers to cover most parts of your body</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use insect repellents which contain more than 30% DEET (diethyltoluamide) on exposed skin. For children, do not use products that contain more than 30% DEET.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do not apply insect repellent to children less than 2 months old. Instead, you can use mosquito nettings over the strollers or baby carrier when you go to areas where your baby may be exposed to mosquitoes</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Burn mosquito coils or hang a mosquito net over your bed when sleeping, making sure the edges are tucked in.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Spray insecticide where the mosquitoes may rest. Mosquito larvae survive well in clear, slow-flowing streams.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Avoid going to an area where malaria is common</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"section\"></h2>\n\n<p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Disclaimers</strong></p>\n<p>This article is jointly developed by members of the National Medication Information workgroup.

It may happen to people when they are on a boat, in a car, on a carnival ride or in other moving vehicles.</div><div><br></div><h2>What are the possible causes of this condition?</h2><div>Motion sickness occurs when your body’s sensory organs sends mixed or different messages to your brain </div><div><br></div><div>Movement is sensed by the brain and it receives signals from</div><div><ul><li>The inner ear, which provides information to the brain about movement, speed and gravity</li><li>The eyes, which provides sight</li><li>The muscles and joints, which senses the position of different body parts compared to other parts of the body</li></ul><p>When the body is moved on purpose, for example when we walk, the signals received from the ear, eye and body tissues match what our brain senses. <br></p></div><div>However, when there is unintentional movement of the body, signals from the eye, ear and body tissues might not match each other. For example, imagine yourself inside the room of a moving ship. Your eyes do not sense movement, but your ears sense movement due to the motion of the ship. The difference in the signal that the eyes and ears send to the brain may cause motion sickness. </div><div><br></div><h2>What are the symptoms of motion sickness?</h2><div>The symptoms of this condition can include the following:</div><div><ul><li>Dizziness </li><li>Nausea or vomiting<br></li><li>Loss of appetite</li><li>Increased saliva production</li><li>Feeling warm </li><li>Cold sweats</li><li>Headache</li><li>Pale skin</li><li>Fast, shallow breathing</li><li>Drowsiness</li></ul></div><div><br></div><h2>What can I do to treat motion sickness?</h2><div>Motion sickness can be treated in the following ways and you can approach your pharmacist to get the following medications. </div><div><ul><li>Cinnarizine</li><li>Dimenhydrinate</li><li>Promethazine</li></ul></div><div>These medications can also help to prevent motion sickness. In general, they work best if you take them at least 30 minutes before your journey.</div><div><br></div><h2>When do I need to see a doctor?</h2><div>Although motion sickness can be treated without a doctor’s consultation, there are times where the condition might be more serious. </div><div>If your condition does not get better in 24 hours or gets worse, you should see a doctor. You should also see a doctor if you experience any of the following:</div><div><ul><li>Nausea or vomiting that continues even after you leave the moving vehicle</li><li>Symptoms of motion sickness that happens even when you are not in a moving vehicle</li><li>Hearing loss</li><li>Chest pain<br></li><li>Signs of dehydration</li></ul></div><div><br></div><h2>What else can I do to manage this condition?</h2><div>Other than using medications to treat the condition, motion sickness can also be managed by the following methods:</div><div><ul><li>You can try lying on your back, closing your eyes or looking at the horizon</li><li>Ginger has been used traditionally to prevent motion sickness. However, ginger may increase the risk of bleeding, especially if you also take blood-thinners such as warfarin or aspirin, so check with your healthcare provider before using ginger supplements.</li><li>You can try applying pressure at the P6 acupressure point on the inside of the wrist, either by applying pressure manually or with an acupressure wrist band. The P6 acupressure point is located three finger breadths below the wrist on the inner arm in between the two tendons (shown by the tip of the pen below). <br></li></ul></div><div><img src=\"https://ch-api.healthhub.sg/api/public/content/ee4b348d7d844d0ab2ada0d4db018dda?v=ec7b17a1\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin:5px;\" /><br></div><div>The following are some suggestions to prevent motion sickness from happening again:</div><div><ul><li>Keep your eyes on the outside world while you are in a moving vehicle. This helps to match what you see, to the movement you are feeling, and makes you less likely to feel sick </li><ul><li>If you are in a car or bus, sit in front and face forward</li><li>If you are on a boat, stay on the deck and look to the horizon. </li><li>If you are in a train or plane, choose window seats</li></ul><li>Avoid reading, looking at a screen, or looking at things close to you while you are inside a moving vehicle</li><li>Stay hydrated by drinking water. Avoid alcohol or caffeinated drinks<br></li><li>Eat small, frequent meals<br></li><li>Breathe in fresh air</li><li>Avoid smoking or smokers</li><li>Use ginger supplements, such as ginger candy, ginger ale, candied or raw ginger</li></ul></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Disclaimers</strong></div><div>This article is jointly developed by members of the National Medication Information workgroup.

Nitrates are used to prevent and treat the symptoms of angina (chest pain). Angina is caused by lack of blood supply and oxygen to your heart. Nitrates work by relaxing blood vessels so that more blood and oxygen is supplied to the heart.</div><div><br></div><div>When you take this medication regularly on a long-term basis, it can help to treat angina by reducing the number of heart attacks that occur.</div><div><br></div><div>Nitrates can also be used with other medications for the treatment of heart failure, a condition where the heart is weak and is unable to pump enough blood to the rest of the body.</div><div><br></div><h2>How should I take/use this medication?<br></h2><div><ul><li>Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional. Stopping your medication suddenly may cause angina attacks. Ask your doctor for recommendations on how to reduce the dose slowly before stopping completely.</li><li>You may take this medication with or without food. The medication may be halved, but do not crush or chew the tablets.</li><li>This medication is used to reduce the number of angina attacks that occur. They should not be used for immediate relief for chest pain.<br></li></ul></div><h2>What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?</h2><div>If you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, take only the usual dose.

Getting up slowly or changing posture slowly may help. Take a rest by sitting or lying down if you feel dizzy.</li><li>This is also more likely to happen if you drink alcohol, stand for a long period of time, exercise or when the weather is hot. Do limit the amount of alcohol you drink while you are on Nitrates. Do take extra care during exercise, when the weather is hot or if you need to stand for long periods of time.</li></ul><li>Temporary headache</li><ul><li>This is a common side effect that will go away after taking the medication for a while. You may choose to take painkillers such as Paracetamol at the start of using Nitrates, to relieve the temporary headaches. Consult your healthcare professional if the headaches do not go away or become worse.</li></ul><li>Flushing or redness of the skin</li><li>Fast heartbeat </li><li>Nausea and Vomiting <br></li></ul></div><h2>What are some rare but serious side-effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?</h2><div>The symptoms of a drug allergy include one or more of the following: </div><div><ul><li>Swollen face/eyes/lips/tongue</li><li>Difficulty in breathing</li><li>Itchy skin rashes over your whole body<br></li></ul></div><div>If you experience any of these symptoms, you should stop your medication and see your healthcare professional immediately.<br><br></div><h2>What food or medication should I avoid when I take this medication?</h2><div>Do not take Sildenafil (Viagra®), Tadalafil (Cialis®), Vardenafil (Levitra®) if you are taking this medication. When Sildenafil, Tadalafil or Vardenafil is taken with Nitrates, your blood pressure can lower greatly, resulting in dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting. In some cases, death has been reported when Sildenafil was taken with Nitrates.</div><div><br></div><h2>How should I store this medication?</h2><div>Store in a cool and dry place, away from direct sunlight.

Eczema is associated with a personal or family history of atopy, which is a group of disorders that include eczema, asthma and allergic rhinitis.</p><h2>What is Eczema?</h2><p>Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a recurrent, itchy skin condition that commonly affects children. Eczema is associated with a personal or family history of atopy, which is a group of disorders that include eczema, asthma and \n      <a title=\"allergic rhintitis\" href=\"https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/Allergic-Rhinitis\">allergic rhinitis</a>.<sup><a href=\"#footnotes\">[1]</a>,<a href=\"#footnotes\">[2]</a></sup></p><h2>Symptoms of Eczema</h2><p>Eczema symptoms can include intense itching, redness, small bumps and flaky, scaly skin. Children usually begin to experience these symptoms before the age of five. Appearance and location of eczema may differ depending on the age<sup><a href=\"#footnotes\">[3]</a>,<a href=\"#footnotes\">[4]</a></sup>:</p><ol><li><p>In babies, eczema tends to occur at the front of the arms and legs, cheeks and scalp. The diaper areas are usually not affected.</p></li><li><p>In older children and adult, eczema occurs at the side of the neck, elbow creases and the back of knees. For adults, eczema tends to affect the face, wrist, hands and forearms. Also, the skin can darken and become thick. Scars can form from repeated scratching.</p></li></ol><p>The affected area can become crusted. Excessive scratching may lead to infection, which appears as painful red bumps with pus.<br></p><h2>Causes of Eczema</h2><p>There is no known absolute cause. While the cause is not completely understood, genes involved in the formation of the skin barrier and the skin’s immune system may play a role in the development of eczema. In most people, eczema is caused by a genetic dysfunction in the outermost layer of the skin. Contrary to popular beliefs, eczema has not been proven to be associated with food allergies. See an allergy specialist if a food allergy is suspected in the child.</p><h2>Diagnosis</h2><p>There are no diagnostic tests for eczema, and diagnosis is usually based on a person’s medical history and physical examination of the skin. A personal or family history of allergic conditions and appearance of symptoms at an early age can also help to confirm the diagnosis.</p><p>\n      <strong>Related: \n         <a href=\"https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/diseases-and-conditions/skin_disorders_in_young_children_nsc\" title=\"Skin Disorders in Young Children I\">Skin Disorders in Young Children</a></strong></p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>Eczema is a chronic condition that fluctuates in terms of severity, where it sometimes improves and worsens. Some people can have no symptoms for many years. It cannot be cured, but symptoms can be controlled with moisturizers, topical and oral medicines, and self-care measures.</p><p>Below are some measures that can be taken to prevent eczema flare-ups:</p><h3>1. Avoiding Trigger Factors</h3><p>Trigger factors include heat (overheating of the skin), perspiration and dry environment. Emotional stress or anxiety may also trigger eczema. Exposure to certain chemicals (e.g. soaps, detergents, perfumes, or cosmetics), materials (e.g. wool or synthetic fibres), dust, sand and smoke also may trigger a flare-up. It may take some effort and time to identify the trigger factors, but it is important to avoid such factors for long-term control of the condition.</p><h3>2. Keeping the Skin Moisturized and Hydrated</h3><p>The skin can be kept hydrated with emollient cream and ointment formulations. They are best applied straight after bathing, and to be used as frequently as possible. While lotions contain more water and are more comfortable for application as compared to creams and ointments, the latter is better at retaining moisture in the skin.</p><p>In addition, take lukewarm baths or showers to hydrate and cool the skin. Use unscented, mild soap or soap-free cleansers. Avoid hot and long baths or showers (do not exceed 15 minutes). Bleach baths may be recommended for severe eczema with recurrent infections. Speak to your pharmacist about this.</p><h3>3. Topical and Oral Medications</h3><p>When there is a flare-up with inflammation and itch, topical steroids may be used. Topical steroids of the right potency should be used for a short period of time to avoid side effects. It is important to apply a thin layer that is adequate to cover up the affected area. Oral antihistamines can also be given for a short period to relieve the itch. Do speak to your pharmacist about obtaining these medications.</p><p>\n      <strong>Related: \n         <a title=\"Desonide Cream or Lotion\" href=\"https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/Desonide-Cream-or-Lotion\">Desonide Cream or Lotion</a></strong></p><h2>Is there any special diet or supplement recommended for controlling or preventing eczema?</h2><p>Probiotics with lactobacillus studied appear to be of limited benefit in improving symptoms<sup><a href=\"#footnotes\">[5]</a></sup>.

It works together with lifestyle changes, such as having a healthy diet and regular exercise, to reduce blood sugar levels. It works by slowing down the breakdown of carbohydrates from our diet to simple sugars. Carbohydrates are a type of nutrient found in starchy foods such as bread, noodles, potatoes, and rice. The absorption of sugar from the digestive system is slowed down. This prevents the rise of blood sugar after a meal.&nbsp;</p><h2><br>How should I take/use this medication?</h2><p>Swallow the tablet whole with a glass of water immediately before a meal or chew the tablet with the first mouthful of food.&nbsp;</p><h2><br>What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?</h2><p>If you missed a dose, take your next dose immediately before your next meal and skip the dose you missed.&nbsp;</p><p>Do not double your dose or use extra medication to make up for the missed dose.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h2>What precautions should I take?</h2><p>Inform your healthcare professional if you:</p><ul><li>Are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication&nbsp;</li><li>Are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding&nbsp;</li><li>Have any heart, kidney, or liver problems&nbsp;</li><li>Drink alcohol often</li><li>Have chronic intestinal disorders such as recurrent intestinal obstruction, inflammatory bowel disease</li></ul><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>If your doctor has informed you that you need to do a fasting blood test, skip your medication until after you have your blood taken and are ready to eat.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h2>What are some common side effects of this medication?</h2><p>Consult your healthcare professional if any of the side effects become severe and bothersome.</p><p>The common side effects of Acarbose include:</p><ul><li>Flatulence (passing gas or wind)<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Stomach discomfort, bloating&nbsp;</li><li>Diarrhoea</li></ul><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h2>What are some rare but serious side effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?</h2><p>The symptoms of a drug allergy include one or more of the following:</p><ul><li>Swollen face/eyes/lips/tongue</li><li>Difficulty in breathing</li><li>Itchy skin rashes over your whole body</li></ul><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>If you experience any of these symptoms, you should stop your medication and see your healthcare professional immediately.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>If the following serious side effects happen, you should consult your healthcare professional immediately:</p><ul><li>Liver problems: Dark-coloured urine or light-coloured stools, yellowing of your eyes or skin, severe loss of appetite, stomach pain, nausea, or vomiting that does not go away</li></ul><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h2>What food or medication should I avoid when I take/use this medication?</h2><p>Avoid taking alcohol with this medication&nbsp;as this may increase your risk of having low blood sugar.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Avoid food and drinks containing sucrose or cane sugar while you are on this medication, as they can often cause stomach discomfort and diarrhoea due to the increased carbohydrate breakdown in the large intestine.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h2>How should I store this medication?</h2><p>Store in a cool and dry place, away from direct sunlight.

Below are some examples to guide you.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">1. Symptoms of cold/flu/influenza may last for more than 2 weeks.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">(a) Runny Nose</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">You choose to bring Cetirizine tablets. Generally, for adults, 1 tablet is to be taken once a day.

Generally, for adults, 2 tablets are to be taken up to 4 times a day. Total = 2 tablets x 4 x 14 days = 112 tablets</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">2. When visiting countries where there may be a concern for stomach upset or diarrhoea (e.g. spicy food, unclean food), preparing an appropriate amount of medications may be enough.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">(a) You will be staying in Thailand for 2 days</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">You choose to bring Loperamide capsules. Maximum of 8 capsules can be taken in a day. Total = 8 capsules x 2 days = 16 capsules</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">3. Chronic medications should also be calculated accordingly.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">(a) You take 1 tablet of Amlodipine 5 mg once a day for high blood pressure. For a 5-day trip, you will need 1 tablet x 5 days = 5 tablets.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">(b) You take 1 tablet of Metformin XR 500mg twice daily for diabetes. For a 8-day trip, you will need 2 tablets a day x 8 days = 16 tablets.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">Ask your pharmacist or doctor for advice if you have doubts!</span></p><h2><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">Where do I get my medications from?</span></h2><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">Most of the medications used to manage minor ailments may be easily obtained over the counter or dispensed by a pharmacist.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">Chronic medications must be obtained from a doctor at clinics/polyclinics/hospitals or from a pharmacist with a doctor’s prescription. Visit your doctor at least a few weeks before your departure to ensure that you have enough medication. You may also ask your doctor to prepare a copy of your medical history with a list of medications which you are taking for you to bring overseas.</span></p><h2><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">How do I pack my medications for travel?</span></h2><ul><li><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">Pack your medications apart from your toiletries.</span></li><li><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">Carry all medications and supplies in their original containers or packaging.</span></li><li><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">Medications which are formulated as tablets or lozenges can be either hand-carried or checked-in.</span></li><li><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">If you would like to carry liquid medications into the aircraft, each bottle should only have a maximum volume of 100ml, and they should be placed inside a ziplock bag, whose volume in total cannot exceed 1L. If the medication bottles are larger than 100ml, you must pack them into a check-in luggage.</span></li><li><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">All inhalers may be hand-carried onto the aircraft.</span></li><li><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">Insulin preparations and devices used to inject the insulin (e.g. needles) should be hand-carried onto the aircraft. Upon arriving at airport security, you should declare to the officers that you have these items and allow these items to be passed through the necessary scans.</span></li><li><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">Bring a copy of your prescription or medication list to answer any questions from airport security regarding the contents of your medication.</span></li></ul><h2><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">How do I store my medications during travel?</span></h2><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">Medications in general should be stored in a cool and dry place. Both the aircraft cabin and the luggage hold of the aircraft meet the criteria.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\">For insulin preparations, you may choose to store them inside a cooler bag to carry onto the aircraft. Most insulin preparations are usually stable at room temperature for around 4 weeks upon first opening, before being discarded. You may ask your pharmacist or doctor or refer to the product’s information leaflet for details.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\"><strong>Disclaimers</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;\"><i>This article is jointly developed by members of the National Medication Information workgroup.

Examples of the different worms are pinworms, roundworms, whipworms, hookworms, tapeworms and flukes.</p>\n<p>A patient with a mild infestation might not show any symptoms. However, some may experience itching around the anal area. The itch normally happens at night when the female worm lays eggs at areas surrounding the anus.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-the-possible-causes-of-this-condition\">What are the possible causes of this condition?</h2>\n<p>A worm infestation spreads most commonly through passing of the worm eggs from the anus to the mouth. Worm eggs are often found under the fingernails of the infected person who has scratched the area around the anus. When the infected person uses their contaminated fingers to handle food or eat, the worm eggs are transferred indirectly from the anus to the mouth.</p>\n<p>Worm eggs that fall off the areas surrounding the anus into the environment can also be breathed in. Worm eggs may also be spread by house dust, from pets or through contact with contaminated objects such as bedding, cups, utensils or doorknobs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-the-symptoms-of-worm-infestation\">What are the symptoms of worm infestation?</h2>\n<p>The symptoms of this condition can include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Itching around the anal area, especially at night</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Poor appetite causing weight loss</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stomach discomfort, diarrhoea, nausea</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Poor sleep</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Being unable to concentrate</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Spotting worms in your stool during bowel movement</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-can-i-do-to-treat-worm-infestation\">What can I do to treat worm infestation?</h2>\n<p>Worm infestation can be treated in the following ways and you can approach your pharmacist to get the following medication.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Albendazole</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"section\"></h2>\n<h2 id=\"when-do-i-need-to-see-a-doctor\">When do I need to see a doctor?</h2>\n<p>Although worm infestation can be treated without a doctor’s consultation, there are times where the condition might be more serious. You should see a doctor if you experience any of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Have blood or pus in your stool</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Are vomiting daily or frequently</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fever</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Extremely tired and dehydrated</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Losing weight with no obvious reason</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Feel sick, have diarrhea or stomach pain for more than 2 weeks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Have a red and itching rash on your skin shaped like a worm</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-else-can-i-do-to-manage-this-condition\">What else can I do to manage this condition?</h2>\n<p>Other than using medications to treat the condition, worm infestations can also be managed by the following methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Wash the clothes and bedding with hot water for the whole family. Do not shake these items before you wash them as shaking the clothes or bedding can spread eggs into the air.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Clean the floor by vacuuming or mopping for a few days after being treated for the worm infestation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Treat family members who are in close contact with the infected person.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following are some suggestions to prevent worm infestations from happening again:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Keep your fingernails short to prevent the transfer of eggs to the fingernails and avoid biting your nails. Cut and scrub the nails of infected persons with a brush and soap.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Practice good hygiene such as washing your hands with soap before cooking, eating, after playing, changing diapers, using the toilet and touching an animal or animal waste.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Make sure your food is cooked properly. You should only drink safe and clean water.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Have daily morning showers to remove any eggs that were laid at the area around the anus.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Avoid walking barefoot.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Disclaimers</strong></p>\n<p>This article is jointly developed by members of the National Medication Information workgroup.

You should not stop taking this medicine even if you do not feel better at the beginning. Continue to take this medicine even after you feel better to prevent your symptoms from returning.</p></li>\n<li><p>Do check with your doctor on the appropriate length of treatment that you need.</p></li>\n<li><p>Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?</h2>\n<p>If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose. Then take the next dose at your usual timing. Do not take two doses to make up for the missed dose.</p>\n<p>If for any reason you stop taking clozapine for more than 2 days, do not start back on the same dose. Ask your doctor what dose you should take.</p>\n<p>If you have problems remembering your doses, speak to your pharmacist or doctor.</p>\n<h2>What precautions should I take?<br></h2>\n<p>Inform your healthcare professional if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>You are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding.

Some of them may affect how this medication works or cause serious drug interactions.</p></li>\n<li><p>You have diabetes. Clozapine may sometimes worsen blood sugar control in diabetes. Maintain regular check-ups with your doctor.</p></li>\n<li><p>You are smoking.

This can lead to serious or sometimes life-threatening infections. Symptoms may include fever, sore throat and/or mouth ulcers that do not go away.</p>\n<p>To prevent this from happening, your doctor will monitor the levels of your WBC with regular blood tests while you are on clozapine treatment – weekly for the first 18 weeks after starting treatment, then at least monthly thereafter.</p>\n<p>If your WBC levels drop too low, your doctor may stop clozapine treatment. WBC levels usually return to normal after stopping clozapine. <strong>Do not restart clozapine without your doctor’s advice.</strong></p>\n<p>It is therefore important to keep all appointments with your doctor – taking clozapine without regular blood tests can be very dangerous.</p>\n<p>Be sure that your family or caregiver are also aware of the above symptoms so they can call your doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.</p>\n<h2>What are some common side-effects of this medication?</h2>\n<p>The mentioned side effects generally affect up to 10% of patients.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Feeling tired or drowsy</li><ul><li>Avoid driving, or engaging in activities requiring concentration</li><li>Discuss with your doctor if you can take the medication at a different time of the day</li></ul>\n</ul>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Nausea or vomiting</li><ul><li>Take the medication with or after food</li><li>Take small but frequent meals and avoid fatty or spicy food</li></ul>\n</ul>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Constipation</li><ul><li>Drink more water (if not on fluid-restricted diet), eat more high-fiber foods, and exercise regularly</li><li>Consult a doctor or pharmacist if you need a medication to help with your constipation</li></ul>\n</ul>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Light-headedness (especially during a sudden change in posture)/ fainting episodes (syncope)</li><ul><li>Get up slowly from a sitting or lying down position</li></ul>\n</ul>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Increase in appetite, weight gain</li><ul><li>Observe healthy dietary habits and exercise regularly</li></ul>\n</ul>\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Excess saliva production or drooling</li><ul><li>Raising your pillows while sleeping may help with drooling</li></ul>\n</ul>\n<p>Most of the side effects listed here will improve with time.

I have cut down my number of sticks. Just a few sticks a day won’t hurt.</h2><p>One cigarette contains more than 7,000 chemicals and compounds, of which 1% are known carcinogens.<br></p><p>Hence, each cigarette you smoke hurts your lungs, your blood vessels, and cells throughout your body, increasing the risk of cancer. Cutting back is not enough to protect you. You have to quit entirely.</p><p>\n         <strong>Related: \n            <a href=\"https://www.healthhub.sg/live-healthy/smoking-increases-your-risk-of-diabetes\" title=\"Smoking Increases Your Risk of Diabetes\">Smoking Increases Your Risk of Diabetes</a></strong> </p><h2>4. I’m smoking ‘filter’ or ‘light’ cigarette which is less harmful.</h2><p>There is no standard definition of what constitutes a light or ultra-light brand. These may refer to the perceived taste and flavour of cigarettes but not their content. Such misleading labels are no longer allowed. Many light, or ultra-light cigarette smokers may also unconsciously compensate by smoking more or inhaling smoke harder and deeper into the lungs.</p><p>Filters do not protect you. They are designed to make smoke particles smaller. That makes nicotine easier to absorb, which in turn increases addiction.</p><p>\n         <strong>Related: \n            <a href=\"https://www.healthhub.sg/live-healthy/questions_smoking\" title=\"Questions on Smoking, Tobacco Use, and Health\">Questions on Smoking, Tobacco Use, and Health</a></strong> </p><h2>5.

Quitting can take several tries. For some smokers, smoking may actually be a habit or a form of mood reliever rather than an addiction.</p><p>Many people who are serious about quitting made several attempts before they quit completely.

Smoking cessation medications don’t help!</h2><p>Some medications, such as nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs), helps to reduce withdrawal symptoms associated with quitting smoking while you focus on resolving other issues that are causing you to smoke. NRTs also help to eliminate the intake of more than 7000 chemicals found in cigarettes.</p><p>Commitment to quitting smoking is an important step, but you are more likely to succeed at quitting if you take advantage of smoking cessation medications with the assistance of a medical professional.

It is used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia, a condition where the prostate gland is enlarged due to a non-cancerous growth and this is caused by overproduction of a hormone called dihydrotestosterone. The prostate is close to the bladder, therefore enlargement of the prostate gland can affect the flow of urine. This leads to urinary symptoms such as a weak or interrupted urine flow, frequent or urgent need to urinate. The medication works by relaxing the muscles of the prostate gland and bladder exit to help relieve these symptoms.</div><div><br></div><div>This medication may also be used for other conditions.

Inform your eye specialist before the operation that you are taking or have previously taken the medication. The pupil may dilate poorly and the iris (the coloured part of the eye) may become floppy during the operation. It is important for the eye specialist to be aware of this as the operation may need to be carried out differently. </li><li>You are taking medications belonging to PDE-5 Inhibitors class such as Sildenafil, Tadalafil or Vardenafil,  for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, a condition where you are unable to get or keep an erection firm enough to have sexual intercourse. You may experience dizziness or light-headedness, which may be caused by low blood pressure upon standing up quickly from a lying or sitting position. In order to reduce the likelihood that these symptoms occur, you should be on a regular daily dose of your alpha1-blocker medications (such as Tamsulosin, Alfuzosin, Terazosin) before you start medications for erectile dysfunction.<br></li></ul></div><h2>What are some common side-effects of this medication?</h2><div><ul><li>Dizziness, light-headedness or fainting </li><ul><li>When taking the medication for the first time, restarting treatment, or starting to take a higher dose, these side effects may occur. They may also occur when you are standing up quickly from a lying or sitting position. If you are affected by this, you should lie down until you feel better then sit for a few minutes before standing again to prevent these effects returning. These side effects usually go away and should not return once you have become used to taking your medication. </li></ul><li>Drowsiness<br></li><ul><li>May affect your ability to drive and use machinery.

It affects nearly 75% of all adult women at least once in their lifetime.</p><h2>What is vulvovaginal candidiasis (vvc) and what causes it?</h2><p>VVC is a yeast infection that is usually caused by <em>Candida albicans</em>. <em>Candida</em> is often found in the vagina without causing any symptoms. When an imbalance occurs, <em>Candida</em> can multiply and cause symptoms of VVC.</p><p>In most cases of VVC, it develops for no apparent reason. However, certain factors can increase your risk of developing VVC:</p><ul><li><p>Use of certain medications such as antibiotics or high-estrogen oral contraceptives.</p></li><li><p>Pregnancy.</p></li><li><p>Poorly controlled diabetes.</p></li><li><p>Weakened immune system – for example, people on chemotherapy or steroids, patients with certain cancers.</p></li></ul><h2>What are the symptoms?</h2><h3>Vaginal Discharge</h3><p>The discharge from VVC is usually creamy white and quite thick, but can be watery sometimes. The discharge does not usually smell.</p><h3>Pain and Itch</h3><p>Some women may experience pain or discomfort whilst having sex or passing urine as a symptom of vaginal thrush. Itching, redness, discomfort or pain of the vulva area is also possible.</p><h2>What are the treatment options?</h2><h3>Topical Treatments</h3><p>These are pessaries and creams which you insert into the vagina with or without an applicator. They contain anti-fungal medicines such as <em>clotrimazole</em>, <em>econazole</em> or <em>isoconazole</em>. A single dose of pessary inserted into the vagina is usually sufficient to clear a bout of thrush. However, some may also want to apply anti-fungal cream onto the skin around the vagina. All anti-fungal vaginal pessaries and creams essentially work the same way and show no differences in effectiveness.</p><p>Combination topical preparation of an anti-fungal with steroid is available and especially helpful if discomfort and itch of the vulva area is disturbing. You can obtain topical treatments without a prescription at pharmacies. Some reported side effects of these medicines are mild burning sensation, itching and redness. Consult your pharmacist or doctor if the symptom persists or become troublesome.</p>​\n\n<p>If you are pregnant, the use of topical antifungals is generally safe in the second and third trimester, but always consult your doctor or pharmacist first.</p><p><em>Note: Pessaries and creams may damage latex condoms and diaphragms and affect their use as a contraceptive. You should use alternative methods of contraception during treatment and for at least five days afterwards.</em></p><p><img src=\"https://ch-api.healthhub.sg/api/public/content/1917583affa9425da1963cfed3722f31?v=823803f2\" alt=\"Canesten\" style=\"margin:5px;\" /> </p><p><img src=\"https://ch-api.healthhub.sg/api/public/content/6760e4cccfa64042a804072d8cfddadc?v=79ce2a16\" alt=\"Gyno-Pevaryl Depot\" style=\"margin:5px;\" /> </p><p><img src=\"https://ch-api.healthhub.sg/api/public/content/930dc6c536b6408f93e82e69569cff85?v=816cdfc6\" alt=\"Gyno-Travogen Ovule\" style=\"margin:5px;\" /> </p><h3>Oral Medication</h3><p><em>Fluconazole</em>, an anti-fungal taken by mouth in a single dose can be obtained from pharmacies without a prescription, on the advice of the pharmacist.</p><p>Side effects are uncommon; nausea, headache, and abdominal pain have been reported.</p><p><img src=\"https://ch-api.healthhub.sg/api/public/content/e13561f396f1424ba352ae75ed0b0e70?v=673826ce\" alt=\"Diflucan\" style=\"margin:5px;\" /> </p><p><img src=\"https://ch-api.healthhub.sg/api/public/content/4b0ef024c2cf4687b63921f0e554088d?v=6f8a6ffe\" alt=\"Apo-Fluconazole\" style=\"margin:5px;\" /> </p><p>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding,<u>do not</u> use these treatments without medical advice.</p><p>You may also consider application of anti-fungal cream onto the skin around the vagina, if discomfort and itch is disturbing.</p><p>Oral and topical anti-fungal treatments are thought to be equally effective. Oral medications may be more convenient, but work slightly slower than most topical treatments.</p><h3>Others</h3><p>The following methods may also help relieve the symptoms of VVC:</p><ul><li><p>Avoid using perfumed products such as soaps and shower gels around the vaginal area, as these may cause further irritation.</p></li><li><p>Use sodium bicarbonate sitz bath for prompt relief of vulva irritation while awaiting onset of antifungal agents. Add 2-4 tablespoons of sodium bicarbonate to 2 inches of warm bath water. Sit in the sitz bath for 15 minutes, 2-3 times in first week, followed by 1-2 times weekly as needed to control symptoms.</p></li></ul><h2>Do I need to see a doctor?</h2><p>Simple and uncomplicated VVC may be treated with self-medication. However, symptoms like vaginal discharge and itch can be due to other causes. Do not assume that all vaginal discharge or itch are due to VVC. Consult a doctor if you:</p><ul><li><p>Are under 16 or over 60 years of age.</p></li><li><p>Are pregnant.</p></li><li><p>Are on certain medications like antibiotics or steroids.</p></li><li><p>Have abnormal vaginal bleeding.</p></li><li><p>Have symptoms that differ from a previous bout of VVC.</p></li><li><p>Have had 4 or more episodes of VVC in the last 12 months.</p></li><li><p>Have had a previous sexually transmitted infection.</p></li><li><p>Have a weakened immune system.</p></li><li><p>Continue to experience symptoms despite use of self-medication.</p></li></ul><h2>What can I do to prevent recurrence of VVC?</h2><h3>Hygiene</h3><p>The normal conditions of the vagina may be altered by excess washing and rinsing out (douching) of the vagina, bubble baths, scented soaps, etc. As a result, the natural defences in the vagina may be affected, allowing the <em>Candida</em> species to thrive. Therefore, washing the external vaginal area with water and unscented soap is recommended instead.</p><h3>Clothes</h3><p>Tight-fitting clothes often trap heat and moisture, which are favourable conditions for the growth of <em>Candida</em> species. Loose fitting clothing is therefore recommended.</p><h3>Sexual Intercourse</h3><p>VVC is not a sexually transmitted disease. However, friction during sex may cause minor damage to the vagina which promotes growth of <em>Candida</em> species. Well lubrication is therefore recommended during sexual intercourse to avoid the recurrence of VVC.</p><h3>Probiotics</h3><p>Probiotics may help to optimise the conditions in the vagina but the evidence on its role in VVC prevention is lacking. Probiotics can be obtained through foods like yoghurt or supplements.</p><p style=\"font-size:12px;\"><u>Disclaimer</u></p><p style=\"font-size:12px;\"><em>Information provided by this patient information leaflet is solely for informational purposes only and is not intended as a substitute for the advice provided by your physician, pharmacist or other healthcare professional.

You can get infected by breathing in droplets containing this bacterium that are sprayed into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes.</div><div><br></div><div>There are two types of tuberculosis: </div><div><br></div><div>1.  Active TB</div><div><ul><li>An infection with <em>M. tuberculosis</em> could present with symptoms. It is possible to spread the infection when you have active tuberculosis that is not treated.</li><li>Common signs and symptoms include coughing for more than three weeks, may be coughing up blood, fever, night sweats, loss of appetite, weight loss, pain in the chest. </li><li>Your doctor may do an X-ray of your chest to observe for any unusual signs in your lungs, or a phlegm test to check for the presence of the tuberculosis bacteria under the microscope.</li><li>Usually treated with a combination of the following four medications: Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Ethambutol and Pyrazinamide. These medications can work together to kill the tuberculosis bacteria.</li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>2. Latent TB</div><div><ul><li>An infection with tuberculosis bacteria but with NO symptoms.</li><li>If you have latent TB, you cannot spread it to another person</li><li>Usually treated with either Isoniazid or Rifampicin.</li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>You might have to take the medication for six to nine months. For active tuberculosis, the first two months usually consists of a combination of the four medications stated above, and the remaining four to seven months is completed using the two medications, Rifampicin and Isoniazid. Do not miss any dose of medication. This may lead to a relapse or worsening of tuberculosis, or a condition with a more resistant form of tuberculosis. In such cases, a longer duration of treatment or use of stronger medications may be needed.</div><div><br></div><div>Depending on your condition, you may need to attend Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) sessions to help you complete your course of treatment. DOT refers to a healthcare worker or trained volunteer supervising the patient taking each dose of tuberculosis medications. The number of DOT sessions can range from once a day to three times a week.</div><div><br></div><h2>How should I take/use this medication?<br></h2><div><ul><li>Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.</li><li>This medication can be taken with or without food. However, if you are having stomach discomfort, you can take them after food instead.</li><li>Take your medications at the same time every day to maintain the same amount of the medication in your bloodstream. </li><li>In children, the medication may be made into a mixture with water before taking. <br></li></ul></div><h2>What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?</h2><div><ul><li>If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Then take your next dose at the usual time. Do not take two doses to make up for the missed dose.</li><li>It is important to complete the entire course of medication, even when you start feeling better during the treatment. This ensures that the tuberculosis bacteria in your body is fully killed.<br></li></ul></div><h2>What precautions should I take?</h2><div>Before starting TB treatment, inform your healthcare professional if: </div><div><ul><li>You are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication</li><li>You have pre-existing medical conditions such as kidney and/or liver problems, gout</li><li>You consume alcohol regularly</li><li>You intend to become pregnant (conceive) or breastfeed while taking this medication</li><li>You are pregnant or breastfeeding</li><li>If you have active TB, you should stay at home for the first two weeks of your treatment. This is to prevent spreading the bacteria to others, as you are more likely to be able to infect others during this period. If you have close, regular contact with family members or friends, encourage them to visit a doctor to test for TB.</li><li>If you need to leave the house, wear a surgical mask in public spaces and avoid crowded places. Avoid close contact with anyone who may have low immunity (including elderly, young children, pregnant women).</li><li>After taking at least two weeks of effective treatment, you are generally considered non-infectious, meaning less likely to infect others, provided that you continue with the rest of the treatment.</li><li>If you have latent TB, seeing a doctor early and receiving treatment can help to prevent your loved ones from getting active TB in the future.</li></ul></div><h2>What are some common side-effects of this medication?<br></h2><div>You may experience muscle aches and/or joint aches. See a healthcare professional immediately if it gets worse or does not go away.<br></div><div><br></div><h2>What are some rare but serious side-effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?<br></h2><div>If you experience any of these symptoms, you should stop your medication and seek immediate medical attention:</div><div><ul><li>Drug allergy symptoms such as swollen face/eyes/lips/tongue, difficulty in breathing, itchy skin rashes over your whole body</li><li>Signs of liver issues such as dark coloured urine or light coloured stools, nausea and vomiting that does not go away, loss of appetite, stomach pain, yellowing of your eyes or skin</li><li>Fever, chills, feeling tired or weak (flu-like symptoms)</li><li>Unexplained bruising or bleeding</li></ul></div><div>There are some tests that are required to better monitor and manage possible side effects from treatment of tuberculosis. These include:<br></div><div><ul><li>Regular blood tests, especially to monitor your liver function<br></li></ul></div><h2>What food or medication should I avoid when I take this medication?</h2><div><ul><li>Avoid alcohol as it may increase the risk of liver problems.</li><li>It is important that you inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medications – including those for current medical conditions, chronic medications, oral contraceptives (birth control pills), over-the-counter medications, supplements and traditional/herbal remedies – as they may interact with TB medications.<br></li></ul></div><h2>How should I store this medication?<br></h2><div>Store in a cool and dry place, away from direct sunlight.

You can get infected by breathing in droplets containing this bacterium that are sprayed into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes.<br></div><div><br></div><div>There are two types of tuberculosis: </div><div><br></div><div>1.  Active TB</div><div><ul><li>An infection with <em>M. tuberculosis</em> could present with symptoms. It is possible to spread the infection when you have active tuberculosis that is not treated.</li><li>Common signs and symptoms include coughing for more than three weeks, may be coughing up blood, fever, night sweats, loss of appetite, weight loss, pain in the chest. <br></li><li>Your doctor may do an X-ray of your chest to observe for any unusual signs in your lungs, or a phlegm test to check for the presence of the tuberculosis bacteria under the microscope.</li><li>Usually treated with a combination of the following four medications: Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Ethambutol and Pyrazinamide. These medications can work together to kill the tuberculosis bacteria.<br></li></ul></div><div>2. Latent TB</div><div><ul><li>An infection with tuberculosis bacteria but with NO symptoms.</li><li>If you have latent TB, you cannot spread it to another person</li><li>Usually treated with either Isoniazid or Rifampicin.<br></li></ul></div><div>You might have to take the medication for six to nine months. For active tuberculosis, the first two months usually consists of a combination of the four medications stated above, and the remaining four to seven months is completed using the two medications, Rifampicin and Isoniazid. Do not miss any dose of medication. This may lead to a relapse or worsening of tuberculosis, or a condition with a more resistant form of tuberculosis. In such cases, a longer duration of treatment or use of stronger medications may be needed.</div><div><br></div><div>Depending on your condition, you may need to attend Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) sessions to help you complete your course of treatment. DOT refers to a healthcare worker or trained volunteer supervising the patient taking each dose of tuberculosis medications. The number of DOT sessions can range from once a day to three times a week.</div><div><br></div><h2>How should I take/use this medication?<br></h2><div><ul><li>Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.</li><li>This medication can be taken with or without food.

This is to prevent spreading the bacteria to others, as you are more likely to be able to infect others during this period. If you have close, regular contact with family members or friends, encourage them to visit a doctor to test for TB.</li><li>If you need to leave the house, wear a surgical mask in public spaces and avoid crowded places. Avoid close contact with anyone who may have low immunity (including elderly, young children, pregnant women). </li><li>After taking at least two weeks of effective treatment, you are generally considered non-infectious, meaning less likely to infect others, provided that you continue with the rest of the treatment.</li><li>If you have latent TB, seeing a doctor early and receiving treatment can help to prevent your loved ones from getting active TB in the future.<br></li></ul></div><h2>What are some rare but serious side-effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?<br></h2><div>If you experience any of these symptoms, you should stop your medication and seek immediate medical attention:</div><div><ul><li>Drug allergy symptoms such as swollen face/eyes/lips/tongue, difficulty in breathing, itchy skin rashes over your whole body</li><li>Signs of liver issues such as dark coloured urine or light coloured stools, nausea and vomiting that does not go away, loss of appetite, stomach pain, yellowing of your eyes or skin</li><li>Fever, chills, feeling tired or weak (flu-like symptoms)</li><li>Unexplained bruising or bleeding</li><li>Visual changes such as not being able to differentiate between red and green colours, blurred vision, eye pain, loss of vision<br></li></ul></div><div>There are some tests that are required to better monitor and manage possible side effects from treatment of tuberculosis.

However, there are many effective treatments available over-the-counter and from the pharmacy to keep the symptoms under control.</p><p>Self-treatment is not recommended if the person affected is less than 2 years old, except in the case of cradle cap. If symptoms do not improve or worsen after 2 weeks of using over-the-counter and pharmacy medicines, see a doctor for further treatment.<sup>6</sup></p><p>\n      <strong>Cradle cap</strong> \n   </p><p>Cradle cap can be treated by washing the scalp daily with a non-medicated baby shampoo. Apply a small amount of baby oil or olive oil to loosen the scales. Gently ​massage the scalp with a soft toothbrush to remove the scales, then shampoo again with a non-medicated baby shampoo. Repeat daily until the thick scale disappears.<sup>2</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>3</sup></p><p>\n      <strong>Topical medications</strong> \n   </p><p>Dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis can be treated with medicated shampoos. After massaging the shampoo into the scalp, leave on for 5 minutes before rinsing thoroughly and repeating the process. Leaving the shampoo in contact with the scalp for the recommended period of time is important to ensure that the treatment is effective. If one type of shampoo does not improve the condition after 4 to 6 weeks, a different medicated shampoo may be used. \n      <sup>3</sup><sup>,10</sup> \n   </p><p>Medicated shampoos may contain one or a combination of the following medications: zinc pyrithione, selenium sulphide, coal tar, salicylic acid and ketoconazole. Steroid creams may also be applied to relief the itch and inflammation in seborrheic dermatitis. Besides ketoconazole, the other medications may be used in children from 2 years old and above.</p><p>Follow closely the instructions of use as stated on the product. Avoid applying medicated shampoos on broken or abraded skin. If the shampoo gets into the eye, flush immediately with plenty of water. If significant skin irritation occurs while using any product, stop using and consult a doctor. </p><p>\n      <strong>Side effects</strong> \n   </p><p>\n      <strong>Selenium sulphide</strong> may discolour hair, especially blond, grey or dyed hair. Rinse thoroughly after use to avoid this effect. Frequent use may also result in a residual odour and an oily scalp.<sup>6</sup>\n   </p><p>\n      <strong>Coal tar</strong> has an odour that may be considered unpleasant. It can stain the skin and hair, especially light-coloured and artificially bleached hair. It may also stain clothing and jewelry. Avoid sun exposure to the scalp and other parts of the body where coal tar has been applied. There is a small risk that coal tar may increase the risk of skin cancer. Avoid using over a large area of the body or for prolonged periods unless instructed by your doctor.<sup>1</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>4</sup><sup>,11,12</sup> \n   </p><p>\n      <span style=\"color:#444444;\">When large amounts of a product containing \n      <strong>salicylic acid</strong> is used, significant absorption into the body may occur, causing toxicity with symptoms including nausea, vomitting and ringing in the ears. Avoid using these products over large areas of the body.<sup>4</sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a>1</a>3</sup></span> \n   </p><p>\n      <strong>Ketoconazole</strong> should not be used in children below 12 years old. Side effects include acne, hair loss, abnormal hair colour or texture and oiliness or dryness of hair and scalp.<sup>14,15</sup> \n   </p><p>Excessive and prolonged use of \n      <strong>steroid creams</strong> may cause thinning of the skin, acne, excessive hair growth, pigmentation changes and stretch marks. They may also cause increase in blood sugar levels and affect certain hormones in the body, resulting in a symptom of 'moon-face' with a condition known as Cushing's syndrome. To prevent these, apply a thin layer of the cream no more than twice a day, and for not more than seven consecutive days. Avoid applying to large areas of the body.<sup>1</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>6</sup><sup>,16</sup> \n   </p><p> ​</p><h2>Where can i find out more?</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Any further inquires can be directed to your doctor, or to a community pharmacist. </p><p> ​​<br></p><p>\n      <strong style=\"font-size:14.6667px;\">Disclaimer</strong> \n   </p><p>\n      <span style=\"font-size:12px;\"><em>Information provided by this patient information leaflet is solely for informational purposes only and is not intended as a substitute for the advice provided by your physician, pharmacist or other healthcare professional.

Carbohydrates, a type of nutrient found in starchy foods such as bread, noodles, potatoes and rice,  are converted into sugar and absorbed into the bloodstream. Insulin allows sugar from the bloodstream to enter the body cells and be used to create energy or be stored for future use. </div><div> </div><div>People with diabetes are unable to fully use the sugar in their bloodstream either because their bodies do not make enough insulin or the cells do not respond well to insulin, a situation known as insulin resistance. Hence, they would need more insulin to get the same effects.</div><div> </div><h2>Insulin Therapy <br></h2><div>There are two main groups of patients with diabetes and their treatment could be different. </div><div><ul><li>Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) requires the use of insulin and the patient needs to control their diet.</li><li>Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients may be treated with oral medications and need to control their diet. In some T2DM patients, they may also require insulin injections.</li></ul></div><div>Insulin is injected into the fatty tissue that is between the skin and muscle layer.</div><div> </div><div> \n      <strong>Starting on insulin when already on oral tablets for T2DM patients</strong></div><div>T2DM is a progressive illness. This means that what you did at the beginning to control your condition through your diet, exercise or medications may change over time.<br></div><div> <br></div><div>As your diabetes progresses, the management of your condition can change from diet and exercise alone, to adding oral diabetes medications. Patients who have had diabetes for a long time may naturally find that they progress to a combination of oral diabetes medications and insulin. </div><div> </div><div>Some T2DM patients might feel that once they have started insulin, it could mean that their condition is now very serious or they have “failed” in controlling their diabetes. However, it is important to understand that this is a natural progression of the disease. If your diabetes is not controlled, it can lead to serious health complications such as an increased risk of heart disease and eye or kidney problems.</div><div> </div><div>If you are on insulin, you should know how to:</div><div> • Measure out your insulin doses</div><div> • Inject insulin yourself (and not rely on others) as far as possible</div><div> • Adjust your diet and activity to your insulin injections</div><div> </div><h2>Types of Insulin  <br></h2><div>There are several types of insulin.

Insulin is injected into the fatty tissue that is between the skin and muscle layer. After insulin is injected, it is absorbed into the blood and is used by your body.</div><div> </div><div>There are three main areas of injection:</div><div> • Abdomen — insulin is absorbed fastest here into the blood </div><div> • Arm</div><div> • Thigh and buttocks — insulin is absorbed slowest here into the blood </div><div> </div><div> </div><div>Your doctor or nurse will advise you on the best area to inject. You should keep to the same injection area (abdomen OR arm OR thigh/buttock) to ensure consistent insulin absorption.</div><div> </div><div>You should rotate the injection site within the same area to prevent your body from forming lipodystrophy (a small lump or dent in the skin that forms when a person repeatedly injects in the same spot). </div><div><ul><li>Insulin injected into these hardened areas may not be absorbed well. </li><li>Check your injection areas every few days by pressing gently and running your fingertips across the skin. </li><li>Inform your healthcare professionals if there are any lumps, painful spots or change in colour anywhere.</li><li>Avoid using these areas until they have recovered.</li></ul></div><div>If you are injecting into the abdomen area, inject at least two inches away from the belly button and avoid areas with scars or bruises. </div><div> <br></div><div>You may refer to <a href=\"https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/Insulin-Injection-Technique\" target=\"_blank\">this article</a> for more details on insulin injection techniques. <br></div><div> <br></div><h2>Handling and storage <br></h2><div>Unopened insulin should be stored in the refrigerator (not in the freezer). Frozen insulin cannot be used. You should always keep at least one extra vial or pen of each type of insulin. </div><div> </div><div>Once opened, the insulin vial or pen should be stored at room temperature and away from direct sunlight. The opened insulin vial or pen can be kept for four to six weeks depending on the type of insulin you use. Refer to your medication label to check how long you can keep your insulin for.</div><div> </div><div>When you are travelling, carry your insulin and syringes with you. Do not put the insulin in your check-in luggage or in your car boot.</div><div> </div><div>Discard the insulin if</div><div><ul><li>It has expired<br></li><li>Your insulin has changed colour</li><li>You are using a clear insulin and you find particles in it. Examples of clear insulins are Apidra, Novorapid, Actrapid and Glargine. </li><li>You are using a cloudy insulin and you see white substances that remain at the bottom of the container after mixing even after you roll the vial or pen thoroughly.  Examples of cloudy insulins are Mixtard and Novomix.</li></ul></div><h2>Insulin Devices </h2><div> \n         <strong>Syringes</strong> </div><div>Syringes are used to deliver the correct and accurate insulin doses to patients. Choose a suitable syringe that best matches the number of units required.</div><div> </div><div>A 0.3mL syringe should be used for doses up to 30 units. A 0.5mL syringe should be used for doses up to 50 units. A 1mL syringe can be used for doses up to 100 units. </div><div> </div><div>Do not reuse insulin syringes. Throw away the syringe after every injection.   </div><div> </div><div> \n         <strong>Insulin Pens</strong></div><div>Insulin pens combine both the insulin cartridge and measuring dial into one device. Some insulin pens are disposable whereas some are reusable. Thus, insulin injections become more convenient as you do not have to carry syringes and insulin vials separately with you. </div><div> </div><div> \n         <strong>Insulin Pumps</strong></div><div>The insulin pump is a small computerised device that pumps insulin continuously through a fine plastic tube into a site under the skin throughout the day. <br></div><div> </div><div>Pump users have to monitor their blood sugar frequently so as to make adjustments to the amount of insulin delivered. The insulin pump generally gives you better control and more meal flexibility but is more expensive and requires more frequent blood sugar monitoring.</div><div> </div><h2>Side Effects  <br></h2><div>The most common side effect with the use of insulin is low blood sugar. If you inject insulin but do not eat on time, your blood sugar may become too low. Low blood sugar levels might also happen if you do not eat well or if you drink alcohol on an empty stomach while on insulin therapy.</div><div> \n         <br> \n      </div><div>Symptoms of low blood sugar include:</div><div><ul><li>Weakness</li><li>Dizziness</li><li>Hunger</li><li>Sweating</li><li>Trembling </li><li>Blurred vision</li><li>Walking unsteadily </li><li>Fast heartbeat</li></ul></div><div>If you experience any of these low blood sugar symptoms, do the following immediately: <br></div><div> \n         <br> \n      </div><ul><div>Step 1: Check your blood sugar level with a home blood sugar meter (glucometer) if available. If your blood sugar level is less than 4 mmol/L, take 15 grams of fast-acting sugar such as:</div></ul><div><ul><ul><li>3 glucose tablets or </li><li>Half a glass of fruit juice (200ml) or</li><li>1 can of less sugar soft drink (330ml) or</li><li>3 teaspoons of sugar, honey or syrup</li></ul></ul></div><div>\n  <br>\n   </div><div><ul><div>Step 2: Monitor yourself for 15 minutes. If you have a glucometer (home blood sugar meter), check your blood sugar level again after 15 minutes. </div></ul></div><div> \n         <br> \n      </div><ul><div>Step 3: If your blood sugar level is still less than 4 mmol/L or you still have symptoms of low blood sugar, you should take another 15 grams of fast-acting sugar as per Step 1.</div></ul><div> \n         <br> \n      </div><div><ul> If your symptoms do not go away, see a doctor or go to the hospital immediately. </ul></div><div> </div><div><ul> Step 4: Take your meal or snack if your blood sugar level is 4 mmol/L and above after consuming the fast-acting sugar earlier on.  </ul></div><div> </div><div>Inform your doctor about this during the next visit.  </div><div> \n         <strong>\n            <br></strong></div><div> \n         <strong>Other side effects include: </strong></div><div><ul><li>Some patients may also experience mild pain, redness, bruising, swelling, a small lump or dent of the skin at the injection site.</li><ul><li>Do not reuse your needles, rotate injection sites within the recommended areas and use shorter needles (4mm or 6mm) to reduce the chances of developing such reactions. </li><li>They also usually go away in a few days to a few weeks. </li><li>See a doctor if you frequently experience this.

Carbohydrates, a type of nutrient found in starchy foods such as bread, noodles, potatoes and rice, are converted into sugar and absorbed into the bloodstream. Insulin allows sugar from the bloodstream to enter the body cells and be used to create energy or be stored for future use. </div><div>People with diabetes are unable to fully use the sugar in their bloodstream either because their bodies do not make enough insulin or the cells do not respond well to insulin, a situation known as insulin resistance. Hence, they would need more insulin to get the same effects.</div><div> \n      <br> \n   </div><h2>Insulin Devices </h2><div> \n      <strong>Syringes </strong></div><div>Syringes are used to deliver the correct and accurate insulin doses to patients. Choose a suitable syringe that best matches the number of units required.</div><div> </div><div>A 0.3mL syringe should be used for doses up to 30 units. A 0.5mL syringe should be used for doses up to 50 units. A 1mL syringe can be used for doses up to 100 units. </div><div> </div><div>Do not reuse insulin syringes. Throw away the syringe after every injection.   </div><div> </div><div> \n      <strong>Insulin Pens</strong></div><div>Insulin pens combine both the insulin cartridge and measuring dial into one device. Some insulin pens are disposable whereas some are reusable. Thus, insulin injections become more convenient as you do not have to carry syringes and insulin vials separately with you. </div><div> </div><div> \n      <strong>Insulin Pumps</strong></div><div>The insulin pump is a small computerised device that pumps insulin continuously through a fine plastic tube into a site under the skin throughout the day. </div><div> </div><div>Pump users have to monitor their blood sugar frequently so as to make adjustments to the amount of insulin delivered. The insulin pump generally gives you better control and more meal flexibility but is more expensive  and requires more frequent blood sugar monitoring.</div><div> \n      <br> \n   </div><h2>How to Inject Insulin  </h2><div>Knowing where to inject your insulin will make the injection easier, safer and more comfortable. Insulin is injected into the fatty tissue that is between the skin and muscle layer.

Nitrates are used to prevent and treat the symptoms of angina (chest pain). Angina is caused by lack of blood supply and oxygen to your heart. Nitrates work by relaxing blood vessels so that more blood and oxygen is supplied to the heart.<br></div><div>\n      <br>\n   </div><div>Nitrates are used to treat angina in three ways:</div><div><ul><li>To relieve an ongoing attack by using the medication at the start of the attack.</li><li>To prevent attacks from occurring by using the medication just before an attack is expected to occur.</li><li>To reduce the number of attacks that occur by using the medication regularly on a long-term basis.<br></li></ul></div><h2>How should I take/use this medication?</h2><div><ul><li>Glyceryl trinitrate is available in different forms, namely sublingual (under the tongue) tablets, mouth sprays and skin patches.<br></li></ul><ul><li>GTN sublingual tablets or mouth spray can be used to relieve angina attacks or to prevent an expected angina attack, e.g. moments before exercising. Symptoms of an angina attack may include one or more of the following:<br></li><ul><li>Chest pain/ chest tightness</li><li>Shortness of breath </li><li>May also be accompanied with heavy sweating, or pain that spreads to your jaw, arm or back.<br></li></ul></ul></div><div><ul><li>The tablet or spray should be used at the first sign of an attack of angina. Do not wait until severe pain occurs. This medication usually provides relief within five minutes. </li><li>If you are using GTN to prevent an expected angina attack, you may dissolve a tablet under your tongue if using tablets or administer a spray under the tongue if using spray, five to ten minutes before you participate in an activity that could cause angina, such as exercise.<br></li></ul><ul><li>Directions on how to take GTN sublingual tablets:</li><ul><li>Place a tablet under your tongue when you experience chest pain. Do not swallow the tablet. </li><li>If the pain is not relieved after five minutes, use a second tablet. </li><li>If the pain is still not relieved after five minutes, use a third tablet. If you still have pain after using the third tablet, seek medical help or call for an ambulance (995) immediately. . </li><li>While waiting for the ambulance to arrive, continue placing a tablet under your tongue every five minutes if your pain continues.<br></li></ul></ul><ul><li>Directions on how to use GTN mouth spray:</li><ul><li>Before using GTN mouth spray for the first time, check that the spray is working by pressing the spray button a few times until it produces a fine liquid mist.</li><li>If you do not need to use GTN mouth spray very often, remember to check the spray regularly to see that it still works properly.</li><li>Remove the plastic cover, and do NOT shake the plastic bottle.</li><li>Hold the bottle upright and close to your mouth, and point the nozzle at the area under your tongue. Press the button to deliver one spray under your tongue.</li><li>Release the button and close your mouth. Avoid swallowing immediately after using the spray, and do NOT inhale the spray.</li><li>Spray once under the tongue when you have chest pain or breathing difficulties.</li><li>If the pain is not relieved after five minutes, use a second spray. </li><li>If the pain is still not relieved after five minutes, use a third spray. If you still have pain after using the third tablet, seek medical help or call for an ambulance (995) immediately. </li><li>Do not use GTN spray if you are near a naked flame, e.g. a cigarette.<br></li></ul></ul><ul><li>GTN patches are applied to the skin to reduce the number of angina attacks.</li><li>Directions on how to use GTN patch:</li><ul><li>Apply the patch to clean, dry skin with little or no hair, free from scars, cuts or irritation.</li><li>Remove the previous patch before applying a new one, and apply a new patch if the patch falls off or comes loose.</li><li>Apply each patch to a different area of the skin to prevent skin irritation.</li><li>Do not trim or cut the adhesive patch to adjust the dosage of GTN. Speak to your doctor if you see the need to adjust your dosage, or if you think your medication is not working.</li><li>The dose of GTN is different for different patients; follow your doctor’s instructions on when to apply and remove the skin patch. The patch is usually left on for 12 hours a day.</li></ul><li>If you have been using this medication regularly for several weeks or more, do not stop using suddenly. Stopping your medication suddenly may cause angina attacks. Ask your doctor for recommendations on how to reduce the dose slowly before stopping completely.<br></li></ul></div><h2>What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?</h2><div><ul>For patients using GTN patches: If you miss a dose, use the missed dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, use only the usual dose. Do not double your dose or use extra medication to make up for the missed dose. </ul></div><h2>What precautions should I take?<br></h2><div>Inform your healthcare professional if: </div><div><ul><li>You are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication</li><li>You are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding <br></li></ul></div></div><h2>What are some side-effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?</h2><div>The symptoms of a drug allergy include one or more of the following: </div><div><ul><li>Swollen face/eyes/lips/tongue</li><li>Difficulty in breathing</li><li>Itchy skin rashes over your whole body<br></li></ul></div><div>If you experience any of these symptoms, you should stop your medication and see your healthcare professional immediately.</div><h2>What are some other side-effects of this medication?</h2><div>Side effects may include:<br></div><div><ul><li>Dizziness, lightheadedness or faintness</li><ul><li>This may occur especially when you get up quickly from lying or sitting down. Getting up slowly or changing posture slowly may help. Take a rest by sitting or lying down if you feel dizzy.</li><li>This is also more likely to happen if you drink alcohol, stand for a long period of time, exercise or when the weather is hot. Do limit the amount of alcohol you drink while you are on Nitrates. Do take extra care during exercise, when the weather is hot or if you need to stand for long periods of time.</li></ul><li>Temporary headache</li><ul><li>This is a common side effect that will go away after taking the medication for a while. You may choose to take painkillers such as Paracetamol at the start of using Nitrates, to relieve the temporary headaches. Consult your healthcare professional if the headaches do not go away or become worse.</li></ul><li>Flushing or redness of the skin<br></li><li>Fast heartbeat </li><li>Nausea and Vomiting <br></li></ul><h2>What food or medication should I avoid when I take this medication?</h2><div>Do not take Sildenafil (Viagra®), Tadalafil (Cialis®), Vardenafil (Levitra®) if you are taking this medication. When Sildenafil, Tadalafil or Vardenafil is taken with Nitrates, your blood pressure can lower greatly, resulting in dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting. In some cases, death has been reported when Sildenafil was taken with Nitrates.</div><div>\n      <br>\n   </div><h2>How should I store this medication?</h2><div>Store in a cool and dry place, away from direct sunlight. Keep this medication away from children. </div><div>Throw away all expired medications. <br></div><div>For GTN tablets: </div><div><ul><li>The medication is sensitive to heat, water/moisture and light. Hence, the following instructions should be followed closely to ensure that the medication stays effective.</li><ul><li>Keep the tablets in the original container in sealed condition until first use.</li><li>Never transfer the tablets into other containers.</li><li>Do not store the tablets in the refrigerator.</li></ul><li>Carry the tablets wherever you go but do not place them in your pocket as it may be too warm.</li><li>Label the bottle with the opening date when you first open it. Throw the bottle away two months after the date of opening, even if you still have tablets left. Do remember to get a new supply of your GTN after throwing the old one away.<br></li></ul></div><h2>How should I throw away this medication safely?<br></h2><div>Pack this medication into a black trash bag and seal it tightly before throwing into the rubbish chute or bin.</div><div>\n      <strong><br></strong></div><div>\n      <strong><br></strong></div><div>\n      <strong></strong></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><strong>Disclaimers</strong></div><div>Please take note that the above is not a complete list of all possible side effects.

Secukinumab blocks IL-17A and helps to reduce the activity of the immune system and the symptoms of the diseases.  </p>\n<p>It may be used alone or together with other DMARDs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-should-i-takeuse-this-medication\">How should I take/use this medication?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Secukinumab should be injected as prescribed by the doctor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Secukinumab is available as a prefilled (ready-to-use) injection.

It should be swallowed whole without chewing and works best when taken at the same time every day.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Leflunomide dose ranges from 10 mg to 20 mg daily. Alternate day dosing may also be used for some patients. The dose may vary depending on your disease activity (disease severity) and response to medication.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Leflunomide does not work immediately. It may take up to 12 weeks before the full benefits of this drug are seen. Thus, it is important to take your medicine regularly, otherwise you may not benefit at all.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Leflunomide may be prescribed to be taken with other medicines (e.g. Corticosteroids) used for treating rheumatoid arthritis.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-should-i-do-if-i-forget-to-takeuse-this-medication\">What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?</h2>\n<p>If you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember.

See a doctor immediately because Leflunomide may reduce your immune response and cause some infections to become more severe. Inform the doctor whom you consult that you are taking Leflunomide. During this period, you may temporarily stop taking Leflunomide for 1-2 weeks until you recover.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Inform your doctor before any surgeries as Leflunomide may increase the risk of infections after the operation and/or slow down wound healing.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Conception and breastfeeding precautions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Reliable contraceptive measures must be used to avoid unplanned pregnancy for women on Leflunomide. Measures that are not reliable include the use of condom and diaphragm and the withdrawal method.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Women who wish to become pregnant while on Leflunomide or after stopping Leflunomide will need to take another medication, Cholestyramine, to help remove Leflunomide from their body. Without this, pregnancy should be strictly avoided for up to 2 years after stopping Leflunomide. If you suspect that you are pregnant while on Leflunomide, inform your doctor immediately. As Leflunomide may be found in breast milk, women are advised not to breastfeed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After taking Cholestyramine, it is recommended for women to avoid becoming pregnant for at least 3 months.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For men who are considering to have children, the continued use of Leflunomide may be considered. Please discuss with your primary rheumatologist.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-some-common-side-effects-of-this-medication\">What are some common side-effects of this medication?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite or weight loss</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Take medication after food to reduce the side effects.

It is used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia, a condition where the prostate gland is enlarged due to a non-cancerous growth and this is caused by overproduction of a hormone called dihydrotestosterone. The prostate is close to the bladder, therefore enlargement of the prostate gland can affect the flow of urine. This leads to urinary symptoms such as a weak or interrupted urine flow, frequent or urgent need to urinate. The medication works by relaxing the muscles of the prostate gland and bladder exit to help relieve these symptoms.<br></div><div><br></div><div>It is also used to reduce high blood pressure in people with hypertension. It works in high blood pressure by widening (relaxing) blood vessel walls thus lowering your blood pressure.</div><div><br></div><div>This medication may also be used for other conditions. Check with your healthcare professional if you are unsure why you are given this medication.</div><div><br></div><h2>How should I take/use this medication?</h2><div><ul><li>Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.</li><li>You may take this medication with or without food. </li><li>The first tablet of a new dose should be taken at bedtime, and subsequently at the same time each day.<br></li></ul></div><h2>What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?</h2><div>If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, take only the usual dose. Do not double your dose or take two doses to make up for the missed dose.</div><div><br></div><h2>What precautions should I take?</h2><div>Inform your healthcare professional if: </div><div><ul><li>You are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication</li><li>You have heart problems</li><li>You ever feel dizzy or faint when you stand up, or if you have ever fainted after passing urine</li><li>You are undergoing cataract (cloudiness of the lens) eye surgery. Inform your eye specialist before the operation that you are taking or have previously taken the medication. The pupil may dilate poorly and the iris (the coloured part of the eye) may become floppy during the operation. It is important for the eye specialist to be aware of this as the operation may need to be carried out differently. </li><li>You are taking medications belonging to PDE-5 Inhibitors class such as Sildenafil, Tadalafil or Vardenafil,  for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, a condition where you are unable to get or keep an erection firm enough to have sexual intercourse. You may experience dizziness or light-headedness, which may be caused by low blood pressure upon standing up quickly from a lying or sitting position. In order to reduce the likelihood that these symptoms occur, you should be on a regular daily dose of your alpha1-blocker medications (such as Tamsulosin, Alfuzosin, Terazosin) before you start medications for erectile dysfunction.<br></li></ul></div><h2>What are some common side-effects of this medication?</h2><div><ul><li>Dizziness, light-headedness or fainting </li><ul><li>When taking the medication for the first time, restarting treatment, or starting to take a higher dose, these side effects may occur. They may also occur when you are standing up quickly from a lying or sitting position. If you are affected by this, you should lie down until you feel better then sit for a few minutes before standing again to prevent these effects returning. These side effects usually go away and should not return once you have become used to taking your medication. </li></ul><li>Drowsiness</li><ul><li>May affect your ability to drive and use machinery. Make sure your reactions are normal before you drive or do things require you to be alert.<br></li></ul></ul></div><h2>What are some rare but serious side-effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?</h2><div>The symptoms of a drug allergy include one or more of the following: </div><div><ul><li>Swollen face/eyes/lips/tongue</li><li>Difficulty in breathing</li><li>Itchy skin rashes over your whole body<br></li></ul></div><div>If you experience any of these symptoms, you should stop your medication and see your healthcare professional immediately.<br><br></div><h2>What food or medication should I avoid when I take this medication?</h2><div>Avoid drinking alcohol as it may increase the risk of dizziness, light-headedness or drowsiness. <br></div><div><br></div><div>Inform your healthcare professional if you are taking or intend to take any other medication, supplements, traditional medications or herbal remedies. </div><div><br></div><h2>How should I store this medication?</h2><div>Store in a cool and dry place, away from direct sunlight.

It is used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia, a condition where the prostate gland is enlarged due to a non-cancerous growth and this is caused by overproduction of a hormone called dihydrotestosterone. The prostate is close to the bladder, therefore enlargement of the prostate gland can affect the flow of urine. This leads to urinary symptoms such as a weak or interrupted urine flow, frequent or urgent need to urinate. The medication works by relaxing the muscles of the prostate gland and bladder exit to help relieve these symptoms.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Tamsulosin can be used alone or with another medication called Dutasteride to treat enlarged prostate gland.</div><div><br></div><div>This medication may also be used for other conditions. Check with your healthcare professional if you are unsure why you are given this medication.</div><div><br></div><h2>How should I take/use this medication?</h2><div><ul><li>Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.</li><li>You may take this medication with or without food. </li><li>Do not crush or chew the tablet as this can affect the release of medication into your body.</li><li>The first tablet of a new dose should be taken at bedtime, and subsequently at the same time each day.<br></li></ul></div><div>For patients taking the combination medication called <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Duodart</span> which contains <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Tamsulosin and Dutasteride</span>; </div><div><ul><li>This medication should be swallowed whole; do not crush, chew or open the capsule as direct contact with the contents of the capsules may make your mouth or throat sore.<br></li><li>This medication should not be touched or handled by pregnant women or women who are of childbearing age. The active ingredient of the medication can be absorbed through the skin, thus women should always use extra caution when they are handling the capsule. If the woman accidentally touches a leaking capsule, she should wash the affected area immediately with soap and water as the medication may affect the fetal development negatively. </li></ul></div><h2>What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?<br></h2><div>If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember.

You may experience dizziness or light-headedness, which may be caused by low blood pressure upon standing up quickly from a lying or sitting position. In order to reduce the likelihood that these symptoms occur, you should be on a regular daily dose of your alpha1-blocker medications (such as Tamsulosin, Alfuzosin, Terazosin) before you start medications for erectile dysfunction.<br></li></ul></div><h2>What are some common side-effects of this medication?</h2><div><ul><li>Dizziness, light-headedness or fainting </li><ul><li>When taking the medication for the first time, restarting treatment, or starting to take a higher dose, these side effects may occur. They may also occur when you are standing up quickly from a lying or sitting position.

A copper IUD can prevent pregnancy because its presence is toxic to sperms. A woman might use emergency contraception if she forgot to take her birth control pills, if the condom broke or slipped off during sexual intercourse, or if no birth control methods were used. </div><div><br></div><div>Postinor-2, also known as “Morning-After Pill”, is one of the pill methods.

You can get infected by breathing in droplets containing this bacterium that are sprayed into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes.</div><div><br></div><div>There are two types of tuberculosis: </div><div><br></div><div>1.  Active TB<br></div><div><ul><li>An infection with <em>M. tuberculosis</em> could present with symptoms. It is possible to spread the infection when you have active tuberculosis that is not treated.</li><li>Common signs and symptoms include coughing for more than three weeks, may be coughing up blood, fever, night sweats, loss of appetite, weight loss, pain in the chest. </li><li>Your doctor may do an X-ray of your chest to observe for any unusual signs in your lungs, or a phlegm test to check for the presence of the tuberculosis bacteria under the microscope.</li><li>Usually treated with a combination of the following four medications: Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Ethambutol and Pyrazinamide. These medications can work together to kill the tuberculosis bacteria.<br></li></ul></div><div>2. Latent TB</div><div><ul><li>An infection with tuberculosis bacteria but with NO symptoms.</li><li>If you have latent TB, you cannot spread it to another person</li><li>Usually treated with either Isoniazid or Rifampicin.<br></li></ul></div><div>You might have to take the medication for six to nine months. For active tuberculosis, the first two months usually consists of a combination of the four medications stated above, and the remaining four to seven months is completed using the two medications, Rifampicin and Isoniazid. Do not miss any dose of medication. This may lead to a relapse or worsening of tuberculosis, or a condition with a more resistant form of tuberculosis. In such cases, a longer duration of treatment or use of stronger medications may be needed.</div><div><br></div><div>Depending on your condition, you may need to attend Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) sessions to help you complete your course of treatment. DOT refers to a healthcare worker or trained volunteer supervising the patient taking each dose of tuberculosis medications. The number of DOT sessions can range from once a day to three times a week.<br></div><div><br></div><h2>How should I take/use this medication?</h2><div><ul><li>Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.</li><li>This medication should be taken at least 30 minutes before food, on an empty stomach. However, if you are having stomach discomfort, you can take them after food instead.</li><li>Take your medications at the same time every day to maintain the same amount of medication in your body.</li><li>In children, an oral liquid formulation (in-house preparation) may be available. Use a medicine spoon or the graduated syringe provided to measure the medicine. Do not use household spoons as they may not be accurate. <br></li></ul></div><h2>What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?</h2><div><ul><li>If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Then take your next dose at the usual time. Do not take two doses to make up for the missed dose.</li><li>It is important to complete the entire course of medication, even when you start feeling better during the treatment. This ensures that the tuberculosis bacteria in your body is fully killed.<br></li></ul></div><h2>What precautions should I take?<br></h2><div>Before starting tuberculosis treatment, inform your healthcare professional if: </div><div><ul><li>You are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication</li><li>You have pre-existing medical conditions such as kidney and/or liver problems, gout</li><li>You consume alcohol regularly</li><li>You intend to become pregnant (conceive) or breastfeed while taking this medication</li><li>You are pregnant or breastfeeding</li><li>If you have active TB, you should stay at home for the first two weeks of your treatment. This is to prevent spreading the bacteria to others, as you are more likely to be able to infect others during this period. If you have close, regular contact with family members or friends, encourage them to visit a doctor to test for TB.</li><li>If you need to leave the house, wear a surgical mask in public spaces and avoid crowded places. Avoid close contact with anyone who may have low immunity (including elderly, young children, pregnant women). </li><li>After taking at least two weeks of effective treatment, you are generally considered non-infectious, meaning less likely to infect others, provided that you continue with the rest of the treatment.</li><li>If you have latent TB, seeing a doctor early and receiving treatment can help to prevent your loved ones from getting active TB in the future.</li></ul></div><div><h2>What are some common side-effects of this medication?</h2><div><ul><li>You may notice orange-red discolouration of bodily fluids such as urine, tears and sweat.</li><ul><li>This is a normal reaction by your body to the medication. Do not be alarmed.</li><li>It is also recommended not to wear contact lenses while taking this medication as it can stain the contact lenses.<br></li></ul></ul></div></div><h2>What are some rare but serious side-effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?</h2><div>If you experience any of these symptoms, you should stop your medication and seek immediate medical attention:</div><div><ul><li>Drug allergy symptoms such as swollen face/eyes/lips/tongue, difficulty in breathing, itchy skin rashes over your whole body</li><li>Signs of liver issues such as dark coloured urine or light coloured stools, nausea and vomiting that does not go away, loss of appetite, stomach pain, yellowing of your eyes or skin</li><li>Fever, chills, feeling tired or weak (flu-like symptoms)</li><li>Unexplained bruising or bleeding</li></ul></div><div>There are some tests that are required to better monitor and manage possible side effects from treatment of tuberculosis. These include:<br></div><div><ul><li>Regular blood tests, especially to monitor your liver function<br></li></ul></div><h2>What food or medication should I avoid when I take this medication?</h2><div><ul><li>Avoid alcohol as it may increase the risk of liver problems.</li><li>Oral contraceptives may not work while you are on Rifampicin. Use a combination of different birth control methods to prevent unplanned pregnancy. </li><li>It is important that you inform your healthcare provider if you are taking other medications – including those for current medical conditions, chronic medications, oral contraceptives (birth control pills), over-the-counter medications, supplements and traditional/herbal remedies – as they may interact with TB medications.<br></li></ul></div><h2>How should I store this medication?</h2><div>Store in a cool and dry place, away from direct sunlight. Keep this medication away from children. <br></div><div><br></div><div>For the oral liquid formulation, follow the expiry date as stated on the medicine label. <br></div><div><br></div><h2>How should I throw away this medication safely?</h2><div>Pack this medication into a black trash bag and seal it tightly before throwing into the rubbish chute or bin.</div><div><br><br></div><div><strong>Disclaimers</strong></div><div>If you take more than the recommended dose, please seek medical advice immediately.

It is prescribed for treating conditions such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), inflammatory myositis, uveitis, vasculitis and inflammatory bowel disease. Occasionally, it is also used in the management of rheumatoid arthritis.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-should-i-takeuse-this-medication\">How should I take/use this medication?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Take azathioprine tablet(s) with or after food to reduce stomach upset. It can cause nausea and vomiting at the start of therapy, but if the dose is increased slowly, your body will usually get used to it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dosage of azathioprine will depend on your body weight, disease activity and response to the medication.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This medicine does not work immediately. It may take between 6 to 12 weeks before you notice any benefit. Thus, it is important that you take your medication regularly, otherwise you may not benefit from the medication at all.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Before starting on azathioprine, your doctor may conduct blood some blood test (i.e. TPMT/NUDT) and adjust your medication dose.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other medications such as corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may be taken with azathioprine.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-should-i-do-if-i-forget-to-takeuse-this-medication\">What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?</h2>\n<p>If you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular dose. Do not take double doses to make up for the missed dose.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-precautions-should-i-take\">What precautions should I take?</h2>\n<p>Inform your healthcare professional if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You plan to start a family or to breastfeed. Azathioprine is generally considered safe in pregnancy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You are taking any other medications, including over-the-counter medicines, supplements, traditional medications and herbal remedies.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you develop a fever, sore throat or feel generally unwell, see a doctor immediately as you may be more susceptible to infections while on azathioprine. The doctor whom you consult should be told that you are on azathioprine.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-some-common-side-effects-of-this-medication\">What are some common side-effects of this medication?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or loss of appetite</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Take medication after food to minimise the side effects. Sucking hard, sugar-free candy may reduce nausea and vomiting. Inform your doctor if symptoms are severe or if you experience loss of appetite.</p>\n</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>\n<p>Loss of hair</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>This is harmless and may not be obvious. It often resolves spontaneously.</p>\n</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-some-rare-but-serious-side-effects-that-i-need-to-seek-medical-advice-immediately\">What are some rare but serious side-effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?</h2>\n<p>The symptoms of a drug allergy include one or more of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Swollen face/eyes/lips/tongue</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Difficulty in breathing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Itchy skin rashes over your whole body</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you experience any of these symptoms, you should stop your medication and see your doctor immediately.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Liver disorder (Warning signs: Yellowing of eye whites or skin, dark or tea-coloured urine or constant pain in the lower tummy area)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Avoid alcohol. Inform your doctor if you previously had jaundice or hepatitis (liver inflammation).</p>\n</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>\n<p>Blood disorder [rare side effect] (Warning signs: May be asymptomatic; unusual bleeding or bruising, lip or mouth ulcers with flu-like symptoms may occur)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>It is important to monitor the effects of your new treatment, particularly during the first three months of treatment. For your safety, you need to do regular blood tests for monitoring.</p>\n</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-food-or-medication-should-i-avoid-when-i-take-this-medication\">What food or medication should I avoid when I take this medication?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Avoid going to overcrowded places and eating raw or undercooked food.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pneumococcal and influenza (flu) vaccinations are safe and may be given if required. Avoid live vaccines such as MMR (measles, mumps and rubella), OPV (oral polio vaccine), yellow fever or BCG (tuberculosis). Discuss with your doctor before receiving any vaccines. Also, avoid direct contact with persons who have taken oral polio vaccine or those with infections.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Allopurinol and febuxostat (medications for gout) should NOT be taken with azathioprine as it may interfere with removal of azathioprine from the body, increasing its immunosuppressive effects as well as side effects. Let your doctor know that you are on azathioprine if they intend to start any gout medications for you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do not drink alcohol while on azathioprine as alcohol can increase the risk of liver problems.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-should-i-store-this-medication\">How should I store this medication?</h2>\n<p>Store in a cool and dry place, away from direct sunlight.

You can get infected by breathing in droplets containing this bacterium that are sprayed into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes.</div><div><br></div><div>There are two types of tuberculosis: </div><div><br></div><div>1.  Active TB<br></div><div><ul><li>An infection with <em>M. tuberculosis</em> could present with symptoms. It is possible to spread the infection when you have active tuberculosis that is not treated.</li><li>Common signs and symptoms include coughing for more than three weeks, may be coughing up blood, fever, night sweats, loss of appetite, weight loss, pain in the chest. </li><li>Your doctor may do an X-ray of your chest to observe for any unusual signs in your lungs, or a phlegm test to check for the presence of the tuberculosis bacteria under the microscope.</li><li>Usually treated with a combination of the following four medications: Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Ethambutol and Pyrazinamide. These medications can work together to kill the tuberculosis bacteria.<br></li></ul></div><div>2. Latent TB<br></div><div><ul><li>An infection with tuberculosis bacteria but with NO symptoms.</li><li>If you have latent TB, you cannot spread it to another person</li><li>Usually treated with either Isoniazid or Rifampicin.<br></li></ul></div><div>You might have to take the medication for six to nine months. For active tuberculosis, the first two months usually consists of a combination of the four medications stated above, and the remaining four to seven months is completed using the two medications, Rifampicin and Isoniazid. Do not miss any dose of medication. This may lead to a relapse or worsening of tuberculosis, or a condition with a more resistant form of tuberculosis. In such cases, a longer duration of treatment or use of stronger medications may be needed.</div><div><br></div><div>Depending on your condition, you may need to attend Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) sessions to help you complete your course of treatment. DOT refers to a healthcare worker or trained volunteer supervising the patient taking each dose of tuberculosis medications. The number of DOT sessions can range from once a day to three times a week.</div><div><br></div><h2>How should I take/use this medication?<br></h2><div><ul><li>Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.</li><li>This medication should be taken at least 30 minutes before food, on an empty stomach. However, if you are having stomach discomfort, you can take them after food instead.</li><li>Take your medications at the same time every day to maintain the same amount of medication in your body.</li><li>In children, the medication may be made into a mixture with water before taking. <br></li></ul></div><h2>What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?<br></h2><div><ul><li>If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Then take your next dose at the usual time. Do not take two doses to make up for the missed dose.</li><li>It is important to complete the entire course of medication, even when you start feeling better during the treatment. This ensures that the tuberculosis bacteria in your body is fully killed.<br></li></ul></div><h2>What precautions should I take?<br></h2><div>Before starting TB treatment, inform your healthcare professional if: </div><div><ul><li>You are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication</li><li>You have pre-existing medical conditions such as kidney and/or liver problems, gout</li><li>You consume alcohol regularly</li><li>You intend to become pregnant (conceive) or breastfeed while taking this medication</li><li>You are pregnant or breastfeeding<br></li><li>If you have active TB, you should stay at home for the first two weeks of your treatment. This is to prevent spreading the bacteria to others, as you are more likely to be able to infect others during this period. If you have close, regular contact with family members or friends, encourage them to visit a doctor to test for TB.</li><li>If you need to leave the house, wear a surgical mask in public spaces and avoid crowded places. Avoid close contact with anyone who may have low immunity (including elderly, young children, pregnant women). </li><li>After taking at least two weeks of effective treatment, you are generally considered non-infectious, meaning less likely to infect others, provided that you continue with the rest of the treatment.</li><li>If you have latent TB, seeing a doctor early and receiving treatment can help to prevent your loved ones from getting active TB in the future.<br></li></ul></div><h2>What are some common side-effects of this medication?</h2><div><ul><li>You may experience numbness or tingling sensations on your hands and feet.</li><ul><li>Continue taking your medication and inform your doctor at your next visit.

COPD is a disease affecting the lungs which make it harder for the person to breathe as the disease gets worse.</div><div><br></div><div>Seretide contains two ingredients, Salmeterol and Fluticasone. Salmeterol helps to keep the airways open, making it easier for air to move in and out of the lungs. Fluticasone is a type of steroid and helps to reduce and prevent swelling and inflammation in the airways. </div><div><br></div><div>Seretide is normally referred to as a ‘preventer’ or ‘controller’ inhaler as it helps to prevent symptoms such as breathlessness in asthma and COPD. It can also help to reduce the chances of having an asthma attack.</div><div><br></div><h2>How should I take/use this medication?</h2><div><ul><li>Use your Seretide inhaler every day to control your condition.</li><li>Do not stop using your inhaler even when you feel well or do not have any symptoms. </li><li>Please refer to the Seretide Accuhaler’s or Evohaler’s patient information leaflet to learn how to use the inhaler. </li></ul></div><h2>What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?</h2><div>If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember.

Thus, you should always carry a fast-acting inhaler, such as Salbutamol inhaler, that would open up your airways quickly to relieve your breathlessness during an asthma attack. Fast-acting inhalers are normally referred to as ‘reliever’ inhalers.</div><div><br></div><div>Please see your healthcare professional if your asthma symptoms get worse. Signs include:</div><div><ul><li>Having to use your ‘reliever’ inhaler more often than before</li><li>Your wheezing (a high-pitched whistling sound made while breathing) or chest tightness gets worse</li><li>Your ‘reliever’ inhaler doesn’t help you as well as before</li></ul></div><div>These symptoms may mean that your condition could be getting worse and you may need extra treatment.</div><div><br></div><h2>What are some common side-effects of this medication?</h2><div><ul><li>Increase chance of experiencing throat irritation, oral fungal infection (seen as white patches in mouth), hoarseness of voice and coughing.

It also increases the risk of skin cancer. In some people, sunlight may induce skin rashes or worsen an existing skin condition. Although your skin has its own natural defense mechanism, it is not enough to prevent the damage caused by ultraviolet radiation.</p>\n<p>The so-called healthy tan is actually a response to sun damage. The skin starts to become darker and the outer layers become thicker in an effort to provide a better barrier against the sunrays. However, the harmful rays are still able to penetrate this natural barrier. Additional protection is essential to prevent damage into the deeper layers of your skin.</p>\n<p>Sunscreens are creams, lotions, sprays or oils that protect the skin from the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation of the sun by providing a chemical or physical barrier to it.</p>\n<p>Chemical sunscreens absorb ultraviolet radiation, preventing it from reaching the deeper layers of the skin. Examples of some common active ingredients are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Cinnamates</p></li>\n<li><p>Drometrizole trisiloxane</p></li>\n<li><p>Octocrylene</p></li>\n<li><p>Oxybenzone</p></li>\n<li><p>Avobenzone (butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane)</p></li>\n<li><p>Octinoxate</p></li>\n<li><p>Salicylates</p></li>\n<li><p>Terephthalylidene dicamphor sulfonic acid</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Physical sunscreens reflect and scatter light, thus preventing the ultraviolet radiation from penetrating the skin. Examples of some common active ingredients include zinc oxide and titanium dioxide.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-should-i-takeuse-this-medication\">How should I take/use this medication?</h2>\n<p>Sun Protection Factor (SPF) is an index to indicate the degree of protection from ultraviolet B (UVB), the type of ultraviolet radiation that is more likely to cause sunburn. The higher the SPF, the longer the duration of the protection. A sunscreen with <strong>SPF 30 or higher</strong> should be applied frequently to maintain protection.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Dry your skin well before applying the sunscreen.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Apply the sunscreen at least half an hour before going into the sun.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Apply the sunscreen generously and evenly over the exposed areas of the whole body.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Wait for the sunscreen to dry before putting on your clothes or makeup.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>With a non-water resistant sunscreen, re-apply after every swim or after heavy perspiration but make sure your skin is dry first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>With a water resistant sunscreen, re-apply every two hours or re-apply every hour if you have been swimming.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use sunscreen even on cloudy or overcast days. The sunrays are as damaging to your skin on hazy days as they are on sunny days.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use sunscreen with SPF of 30 or higher during high altitude activities such as skiing and mountain climbing. At high altitudes, there is less atmosphere to absorb the sunrays, so exposure to the sunrays is higher and the risk of your skin burning is higher.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-precautions-should-i-take\">What precautions should I take?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Inform your healthcare professional if you are allergic to this sunscreen or any of its ingredients.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you have oily or acne-prone skin, avoid greasy formulations of sunscreens.</p></li>\n<li><p>Other ways to maximise sun protection include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Avoiding the sun when it is strongest between 11am to 3pm.</p></li>\n<li><p>Wearing protective clothes under the hot sun. Even if you are under the shade on the beach, sunrays can be reflected off the sand and cause a burn on your skin.</p></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"section\"></h2>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-some-common-side-effects-of-this-medication\">What are some common side-effects of this medication?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Temporary stinging sensation</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-some-rare-but-serious-side-effects-that-i-need-to-seek-medical-advice-immediately\">What are some rare but serious side-effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Symptoms of a severe allergic reaction which include one or more of the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Swollen face/eyes/lips/tongue</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Difficulty in breathing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Itchy skin rashes over your whole body</p>\n</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>\n<p>Skin redness or irritation such as burning, itching</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Localised skin rash or swelling</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pimples (acne)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pain in hairy areas</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pus in the hair follicles</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you experience any of these symptoms, you should stop your sunscreen and see your healthcare professional immediately.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-should-i-store-this-medication\">How should I store this medication?</h2>\n<p>Store in a cool and dry place, away from direct sunlight.

They are the only forms that can be self-treated.</p><p>Family history and hormone abnormalities (e.g. dihydrotestosterone) are some of the causes of male pattern and female pattern hair loss. Use of certain medications (e.g. b-blockers, ibuprofen) and underlying medical problems (e.g. hypothyroidism) may also contribute to hair loss.</p><h2>What are the symptoms?</h2><p>There is a gradual thinning of hair with no signs of redness, inflammation or scarring on the scalp.</p><h2>What are the treatment options?</h2><h3>Topical Treatment</h3><p>Topical solution, lotion or foam containing Minoxidil are applied to the affected area of the scalp. Minoxidil works by increasing blood flow to the hair follicles and stimulates them to increase hair growth and slow balding.</p><p>You can obtain topical treatment of Minoxidil without a prescription at pharmacies. Some reported side effects of the medicine are itching, dryness, irritation and scaling at the site of application. Consult your pharmacist or doctor if the symptoms persist or become troublesome.</p><p> \n      <em>Note: The rate of new hair growth varies from person to person. Hair growth usually occurs after at least 2 to 4 months with continuous use. Topical Minoxidil is only effective for as long as it is used. Hair loss will occur over a period of 3 to 4 months after Minoxidil treatment is stopped.

This provides your body with nicotine to control baseline nicotine withdrawal symptoms.</div><div><br></div><h2>How should I use this medication?</h2><div>On waking up, remove the backing of the patch and apply onto any hairless, clean and dry area of your chest, back, upper arm, thigh or hip. Hold down for 10 seconds and run your finger around the edges of the patch to ensure proper adhesion.</div><div><br></div><div>Before going to sleep, remove the patch, fold the used patch into half with the sticky sides together and throw it away. </div><div><br></div><div>Apply the patch to a different site each day to reduce skin irritation.

Dosage may vary depending on your disease activity and response to the medicine.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tablets should be taken with or after food. It should be swallowed whole with a glass of water, without chewing or crushing.

Thus, it is important that you take your medication regularly, otherwise you may not benefit at all.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Medications, such as corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and other DMARDs may be taken with methotrexate.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-should-i-do-if-i-forget-to-takeuse-this-medication\">What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember if it is within 2 days from your scheduled dose.

This is because methotrexate can cause miscarriage and serious birth defects, and should be avoided before conceiving and during pregnancy. Reliable contraceptive measures must be used to avoid unplanned pregnancy whilst taking methotrexate. Patients should also wait at least three months after stopping methotrexate before trying for a child. In addition, women are advised not to breastfeed as methotrexate is excreted into the breast milk.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For male patients who are considering to have children, the continued use of methotrexate may be considered.

While aciclovir cream does not prevent cold sores from coming back, it can reduce the severity and duration of the cold sore symptoms when they appear.</p><p>Symptoms of cold sores often include itching, burning or tingling before blisters appear. The blisters may merge and burst before crusting over. The HSV is able to infect other parts of the body or can spread to others, via direct contact with the cold sores or contaminated items (e.g. towels, eating and drinking utensils). The HSV can also be sexually transmitted.</p><h2>How should I use this medication?</h2><p>Wash and dry hands before and after use to prevent the spread of infection</p><p>Apply aciclovir cream on the blisters. It is best to apply when the first signs of a cold sore appear (e.g. itching, tingling)</p><p>Apply a thin layer to the affected areas 5 times a day, approximately every 4 hours. You do not need to apply the cream when you are asleep</p><p>Continue application for at least 5 days, or up to 10 days if the cold sores have not healed</p><p>For cold sores on the lips, apply aciclovir cream after eating or drinking to minimize accidental swallowing of the medication</p><h2>What should I do if I forget to use this medication?</h2><p>If you forget to apply a dose, apply as soon as you remember. If it is nearly time for the next application, skip the missed application and continue with the next dose at the usual time.</p><h2>What precautions should I take?</h2><p>Inform your healthcare professional if:</p><p>You are allergic to this medication &amp; other similar antivirals (e.g. valacyclovir), or any of the other ingredients of this medication (e.g. propylene glycol)</p><p>You have a weakened immune system due to an illness such as AIDS (Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome) or you have had a bone marrow transplant</p><p>Take care to avoid accidental application into the eye or inside the mouth.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>What are some common side-effects of this medication?</h2><p>Itching</p><p>Temporary burning or stinging sensation after application</p><p>Mild drying or flaking of skin</p><p>Consult your healthcare professional if the symptoms do not go away or become bothersome.<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>What are some rare but serious side-effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?</h2><p>The symptoms of a drug allergy include one or more of the following:</p><p>Swollen face/eyes/lips/tongue</p><p>Difficulty in breathing</p><p>Itchy skin rashes over your whole body</p><p>If you experience any of these symptoms, you should stop your medication and see your healthcare professional immediately.</p><h2>How should I store this medication?</h2><p>Store in a cool and dry place, away from direct sunlight.
