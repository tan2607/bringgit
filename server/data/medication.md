```

## What is this medication for?

Ustekinumab belongs to a class of medicines called biologics. Biologics are genetically engineered proteins. Ustekinumab works by blocking the activity of proteins known as interleukin (IL) 12 and 23.

IL-12/23 levels are increased in diseases such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. This medication helps to reduce the activity of the immune system and the symptoms of the disease.

Ustekinumab does not work immediately and it may take several weeks before you notice any improvement in symptoms.

## How should I take/use this medication?

Ustekinumab should be taken as prescribed and you should not stop using the medication without discussing it with your doctor. Stopping Ustekinumab abruptly may cause the symptoms of your condition to return.

It may be taken alone, with methotrexate, or with other disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).

Ustekinumab is available in a solution for injection that comes in a pre-filled form (ready-to-use). It is given via injection under the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach, thigh or upper outer arm or into the blood vessel (intravenous infusion). You and your doctor will decide if you should administer Ustekinumab yourself. You or your carer should receive training on how to inject the medication from your doctor, pharmacist or specialty nurse prior to attempting administration on your own. Always remember to rotate the injection site.

Your doctor will decide how much Ustekinumab you need and for how long.

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

If you miss a dose, inject it as soon as you remember. Talk to your doctor to discuss when the next dose should be given.

## What precautions should I take?

    *   If you are breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed, discuss with your doctor if you should breastfeed or use Ustekinumab.
        
*   You have a history of:
    
    *   Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C
        
    *   Tuberculosis

*   Blocked or runny nose
    
*   Sore throat

Ustekinumab may reduce your body’s ability to fight against infection. You should consult a doctor immediately if you develop a fever or feel unwell. Inform the doctor whom you consult that you are taking Ustekinumab as the medication may need to be stopped while you are having an infection.

You may need to have regular blood tests while on Ustekinumab.

title: Atropine Eye Drop (for Myopia Users)
url_slug: atropine-eye-drop-for-myopia-users
keywords: atropine,Myopine,
```

## What is this medication for?

Atropine eye drop helps to slow down the progression of myopia in children and teenagers. Myopia, also known as near-sightedness or short-sightedness, is a condition where a person can see near objects well (when reading a book or working on the computer) but has difficulty seeing objects that are far away (road signs or bus numbers).

Usually a low dose of atropine (0.01% to 0.10%) will be prescribed first. If the dose is not effective in slowing down short-sightedness, a higher dose of atropine (0.5% to 1.0%) may be prescribed.

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   Proper use of eye drop
    
    *   Click on this link for a step-by-step guide on how to apply eye drops for your child / how your child can apply eye drops by himself or herself.  
        [https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/A-Step-By-Step-Guide-On-How-To-Instil-Eye-Drops](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/A-Step-By-Step-Guide-On-How-To-Instil-Eye-Drops)  
        
    *   If your child needs to use more than 1 drop of medication, or if your child is using another type of eye drop, wait at least 5 to 10 minutes before applying the next eye drop. This is to prevent the first drop of medication from being washed away by the second drop of medication before it has time to work. This also prevents any interactions between different eye drops.  
        
    *   If your doctor prescribed both eye drops and eye ointments, your child should use the eye drops first.  
        

*   Your child should not stop using medication without checking with your healthcare professional.  
    

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

If your child forgets to use a dose, use it as soon as you remember. Then use your next dose at the usual time. Do not use two doses to make up for the missed dose.

## What precautions should I take?

Inform your healthcare professional if:

*   Your child is allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication.
    
*   Your child is taking any other medications, including supplements, traditional medications and herbal remedies.
    
*   Your child has a history of closed-angle or narrow-angle glaucoma. (This is a condition where the fluid drainage structure inside the eye gets blocked. This results in fluid buildup and increased eye pressure that damages the eye’s nerve.)
    
*   Your child is using any other eye preparations.
    

## What are some common side-effects of this medication?

*   Eye stinging or burning sensation
    
*   Eye redness
    
*   Glare/ Sensitivity to bright light (usually only with higher doses)
    
    *   Tinted glasses, sunglasses or hats may be used to reduce glare
        
*   Blurring of near vision (usually only with higher doses)
    
    *   Your child may have difficult doing any activities that require concentration (e.g reading/close work)
        

Side effects of glare/blurring of near vision are less likely to occur with low-dose atropine. Check with your healthcare professional if these conditions are severe or do not improve.

## What are some rare but serious side-effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?

The symptoms of a drug allergy include one or more of the following:

*   Swollen face/eyes/lips/tongue
    
*   Difficulty in breathing
    
*   Itchy skin rashes around the eyes or over the whole body
    

If your child experiences any of these symptoms, he/she should stop the medication and see his/her healthcare professional immediately. In most cases, the allergy is mild and can be controlled with anti-allergy medication. If the allergy is severe, atropine may be stopped.

**Mefenamic Acid / Naproxen / Ibuprofen (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs or NSAIDs)**  

**What is this for​**  

​These are painkillers which can help to reduce moderate to severe pain, or when your pain is not relieved by paracetamol.   

**​How to take**  

Take when necessary or as directed by your doctor. Take after food.  

**​Side effects**  

Stomach discomfort or gastric irritation is a common side effect.  Taking this medication after food reduces this side effect. You may also be given some medications such as antacids that will help protect the stomach from gastric irritation.  

**​Other considerations**  

​There are many types of NSAIDs available; however not all NSAIDs are safe for breast-feeding. If you are taking any NSAIDs other than the ones stated in this leaflet, please check with your healthcare professional if it is safe to be used while you are breast-feeding.  

  

**Stomach Protectants e.g. antacids / famotidine**  

**What is this for​**  

Antacids or famotidine may be prescribed by your doctor as a stomach protectant when you are given NSAIDs, to help with stomach discomfort.  

**​How to take**  

As antacids may come in tablet or liquid form, always follow the instructions provided. Most antacids are usually chewable tablets and you should chew them before taking the NSAIDs. 

  

Famotidine is usually given once or twice daily, and can be taken together with NSAIDs.  

**​Side effects**  

Generally well tolerated without any significant side effects.    

​**Other considerations**  

You may need to space antacids at least 2 hours apart from some medications. Please check with your healthcare professional if you are taking some other medications.  

  

**Multivitamins and Iron supplements**   

**What is this for​**  

Iron is needed to make red blood cells. Multivitamins containing iron or plain iron supplements may be given after a delivery, to help replenish the blood loss during delivery.  

**​How to take**  

​Follow the instructions on the medication label.   

**​Side effects**  

Generally well tolerated. Some of the common side effects are:

● Dark-coloured stools. This is harmless.

● Constipation. You can drink more water and take plenty of fruits and vegetables to prevent it.  

**​Other considerations**  

For supplements containing iron, space at least 2 hours apart from coffee, tea, milk, dairy products, and calcium-containing supplements for better iron absorption.

(Exception: Iron polymaltose e.g. Maltofer / Floron).  

  

**Laxatives e.g. liquid paraffin / lactulose**

It may be taken with or without food.  

**​Side effects**  

​Generally well tolerated.

**​Other considerations**  

If you are prescribed liquid paraffin: Do not lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking this medicine to avoid aspiration pneumonia (medicine leaking back into the lungs).

Avoid taking Liquid Paraffin with multivitamins as it may interfere with the absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins in multivitamins. Space at least 1 hour apart between these two medications.  

  

**Galactogogues e.g. domperidone / fenugreek**  

**What is this for​**

Generally well tolerated.  

  

What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?  

You should take multivitamins and iron supplements regularly. If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Then take your next dose at the usual time. Do not take two doses to make up for the missed dose.  

  

Most of the other post-natal medications are only to be taken if you have symptoms, if you have no symptoms, you do not need to take the medication.

  

  

## What else can I do?

*   Drink at least 8-10 cups of fluids daily. This replaces fluids lost through breastfeeding and also helps to relieve constipation. Be sure to avoid sugar sweetened drinks!
*   Have a supply of staple food items (e.g. rice/noodles/pasta, eggs, frozen vegetables) so that quick easy meals can be made
*   Cook extras at dinner and freeze in single portions to use at busy times.
*   Have healthy snacks readily available for convenience when hungry (e.g. tubs of yogurt, dried fruit and nuts, wholemeal crackers, fruit).
*   You should try to limit alcohol consumption while you are breast-feeding. Generally, moderate alcohol intake by the breast-feeding mother (up to 1 standard drink a day) is not known to be harmful. You should also:

*   Wait for at least 3 hours after alcohol consumption before the next breastfeed.
*   Avoid alcohol completely in the 1st week after delivery as (i) baby’s liver is not completely mature, and (ii) to allow establishment of breast milk supply so that breast milk can be pumped and stored for later use in case baby needs an earlier feed.

*   Limit to 2 cups of coffee or tea per day as caffeine has been shown to pass to babies through breast milk.

  

## What are some rare but serious side-effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?

Symptoms of a drug allergy include one or more of the following:

*   Swollen face/eyes/lips/tongue
*   Difficulty in breathing
*   Skin rashes 

If you experience any of these symptoms, stop taking the supplement and seek immediate medical attention.

​This leaflet describes some of the common supplements prescribed by your healthcare professional during your pregnancy.    

**Folic Acid**   

_(usually taken from preconception till the 12th week of pregnancy)_  

**What is this for​**  

​To reduce the risk of birth defects, e.g. abnormal development of the spinal cord in the baby during the early stages of pregnancy.  

**​How to take**

**What is this for​**  

Most prenatal vitamins contain a higher content of micronutrients to meet the increased demand during pregnancy. For example, most prenatal vitamins will contain iron, calcium and folic acid to meet the needs of the baby and mother. Iron helps with the formation of red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the baby. Calcium will help strengthen the baby’s bone development. 

  

Not all multivitamins are safe in pregnancy as they may contain higher than necessary contents e.g. some multivitamins may contain higher doses of Vitamin A that may not be safe in pregnancy. Check with your healthcare professional before buying any multivitamins on your own. 

**​How to take**  

Dose is usually one tablet/capsule after breakfast or lunch. 

Follow the instructions stated on the medication label / packaging.

Follow the instructions stated on the medication label / packaging.  

**​Side effects**

Constipation – drink more water and take plenty of fruits and vegetables to prevent it.  

**​Other considerations**  

Space at least 2 hours apart from milk, dairy products, and supplements that contain iron to improve absorption. 

Some preparations may contain Vitamin D to enhance calcium absorption.  

  

**Iron (E.g. Sangobion / Hemoplex / Maltofer / Floron / Maltofer Drops)**  

_(usually taken when your hemoglobin levels are low)_  

**What is this for​**  

For the production of red blood cells to treat anemia (low red blood cell count) and to meet the increased iron needs of both mother and baby.  

**​How to take**  

Take one to two tablets/capsules a day with or after food.

Sometimes, your doctor may prescribe a liquid preparation for you if you are unable to swallow tablets.

Follow the instructions as stated on the medication label / packaging.

Side effects Generally well tolerated in most patients. Some patients may experience 

● Dark-coloured stools. This is harmless.

● Constipation. You can drink more water and take plenty of fruits and vegetables to prevent it.  

​**Other considerations**  

Most iron supplements may need to be spaced at least 2 hours apart from coffee, tea, milk, dairy products, and calcium or other iron-containing supplements to improve absorption (Exception: iron polymaltose e.g. Maltofer / Floron).  

  

**Vitamin D**

_(only required when determined by your doctor)_  

**What is this for​**

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

Medications for nausea and vomiting are to be taken only when necessary. If you have no symptoms, you do not need to take the medication.   

  

## What else can I do?  

**​Do’s** 

*   Drink enough fluid throughout the day to ensure you are well-hydrated (sip in small amounts so that it is better tolerated).
*   Suck on ice cubes or a spoonful of crushed ice if you have difficulty keeping fluids down.  
*   Eat dry biscuits or toast in the morning when you get up. 
*   Get up slowly and do not lie down right after eating as this delays gastric emptying. 
*   Eat smaller but more frequent meals \[i.e. every 2 hours\] to avoid an overly full stomach and to ensure your stomach is never empty, as this can cause nausea.
*   Eat cold or cooled food instead of hot food as cold food tends to have less smell that may trigger nausea or vomiting.
*   Have a range of food on hand with different tastes and textures \[i.e. sweet, salty, crunchy\] as your taste may change throughout the day. 
*   If you are producing too much saliva, spit it out instead of swallowing it. The bitter taste of saliva may cause nausea and vomiting.
*   You may take simethicone or antacid for gas, bloating or heartburn symptoms. Sometimes, your doctor may prescribe medications such as famotidine or omeprazole for more severe heartburn symptoms.
*   Try consuming ginger-containing foods or drinks.
*   Get plenty of rest (tiredness can make nausea worse).   
    

**​​Don’ts**

*   Do not skip meals or go on for a long time without eating. 
*   Avoid excessive carbonated or caffeinated drinks, as it may cause heartburn or nausea. 
*   Avoid warm places, as this may increase the feeling of sickness. 
*   Avoid strong odours including cigarette smoke, perfumes and chemicals.
*   Avoid cooking or eating spicy food, oily food, foods with a strong smell, as these can cause heartburn or nausea.

url_slug: Topical-Estrogen-Oestrogel-and-Divigel
keywords: estrogen,Oestrogel,Divigel,Estradiol,
```

## ​What is this medication for?

Topical estrogen is a type of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) that contains a female hormone, estrogen. It is applied onto the skin. It is used to treat menopausal symptoms like hot flushes, excessive sweating, vaginal dryness and bone loss. These symptoms are typically caused by a decrease in the levels of estrogen in the body, which happens naturally after menopause. Topical estrogen works by replacing the estrogen in the body.  

  

Using estrogen alone may cause unusual thickening of the uterus (womb) lining.Hence women who have an intact uterus will require an additional female hormone, progestogen, to prevent this. If your doctor prescribes progestogen to be taken for a specific duration (usually 10 – 14 days) each month, you will experience a withdrawal bleed (menses) after finishing the progestogen capsules/tablets.

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   Do not stop using your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.
*   There are two types of topical estrogen available – Oestrogel® and Divigel®.
*   The medication should be applied once a day, around the same time each day. 
*   Before using the medication, clean your skin, wash your hands and allow them to dry thoroughly.
*   Oestrogel®:

*   The medication comes in a tube, with a graduated measure (ruler).
*   Unless otherwise directed by the doctor, start with measuring out ½ ruler (1.25g) of the gel and slowly increase to 1 ruler (2.5g) of the gel. 

*   Divigel®:

*   The medication comes in sachets.
*   Open the sachet and squeeze out the contents onto the skin.

*   Apply the medication to the skin of the outer upper arms, lower part of the stomach or the right or left thigh.
*   The medication should be applied over a large surface, about 1 – 2 times the size of your hand.
*   **Do not apply the medication to the face, breasts or vaginal area as well as on cuts, scrapes or irritated skin.**
*   After the application, allow the gel to dry for a few minutes and do not wash the area for at least one hour. Wash your hands after application.

url_slug: Administration-How-to-Use-Vaginal-Pessaries
keywords: Pessary,pessaries,vaginal tablet,
```

​This leaflet explains the correct method of inserting vaginal pessaries.    

1\. Wash your hands and vaginal area with a gentle cleanser/soap and water. 

  

Dry it thoroughly. 

        ![](https://ch-api.healthhub.sg/api/public/content/f728b9cf7ce24750a927d73cbb41d86b?v=5a3bf97b)

2\. Remove the pessary from the packaging/wrapper.

  

(a) Some medications come as a **pre-filled applicator** (which means that the pessary is already pre-inserted into the applicator). 

  

(b) Others may have a **separate applicator**, where you will need to insert the pessary into the end of the applicator.

  

(c) If no applicator is supplied, you can insert the pessaries using your fingers.  

  

**Note:** During pregnancy, the pessary should be inserted **without** using an applicator.  

  

![](https://ch-api.healthhub.sg/api/public/content/6ba29b0e2a4a4c7ebc82e625e77f169d?v=64fb1eec)  

3. Lie on your back with your knees bent and legs slightly apart.

  

  

  

Gently insert the pessary (pointed end first) **or** applicator into the vagina, as far as comfortably possible.  

  

  

  

If using an applicator, push the plunger until it stops to release the pessary into the vagina. 

Then, remove the applicator from the vagina.

Symptoms of meningococcal disease may include a sudden onset of headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, light sensitivity, neck stiffness, a rash of red-purple spots or bruises. Young children may present with less specific symptoms such as irritability, crying, difficulty in waking or refusal to eat.

Meningococcal disease is spread through direct person-to-person contact (e.g. through saliva during kissing) or when in close and prolonged contact with an infected person through the air (e.g. coughing or sneezing). A person who is well but a carrier of the bacteria in their body, may also spread the disease.

While the risk of meningococcal disease is rare in most countries, it is a severe disease with a significant risk of death or lasting disabilities in people who get it.

## Who Should Receive the Meningococcal Vaccine?

The meningococcal vaccine is recommended for the prevention of meningococcal disease among high-risk groups such as:

*   Persons travelling to Mecca for the Hajj or Umrah (a mandatory requirement by Saudi Arabia’s government)

```

## ​What is this medication for?

Evolocumab is a type of monoclonal antibody (a man-made protein that attaches to a target in the body) that increases the liver’s ability to remove bad cholesterol. This lowers the amount of ‘bad cholesterol’ in the blood.  

  

High ‘bad cholesterol’ levels can cause blood vessels to clog up and lead to chest pain (angina), heart attack or stroke. By reducing the amount of bad cholesterol in the body, this medication reduces the risk of future heart attack and stroke.   

  

This medication may also be used for patients with high ‘bad cholesterol’ levels in their blood because of a hereditary condition (a medical condition that runs in the family).

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.

```

## What is the HPV Vaccine Used For?  

HPV vaccines help to prevent infection with Human Papillomavirus (HPV), which may lead to cervical, vaginal and vulvar cancer in women, or anal cancer and genital warts in both women and men. 

HPV infection spreads from one person to another through skin-to-skin contact such as during sexual activity, or less frequently during delivery from an infected mother to her baby.

Most HPV infections, including the strains that can cause cervical cancer, do not have any signs or symptoms. Symptoms of cervical cancer may include abnormal vaginal bleeding such as bleeding after menstrual periods or after sex. There may also be changes in the amount, colour or smell of vaginal discharge. It is recommended to have regular screening, e.g. Pap smear to detect cervical cancer early.

## What are the types of HPV vaccines available in Singapore?

There are two types of HPV vaccines available in Singapore. They are the HPV2 (Cervarix), and HPV9 (Gardasil 9). Cervarix provides protection against HPV types 16 and 18, which account for 70% of all cervical cancers, and have been shown to be both clinically- and cost-effective in the local setting. It is registered for use in females. Gardasil 9 provides protection against an additional 20% of cancer-causing HPV types. It is registered for use in both females and males.

## Who Should Receive the HPV Vaccine?

For those under 15, there is a total of 2 doses and for those 15 and above it is a total of 3 doses (at intervals of 0, 1-2 months and 6 months). Although not included in the NCIS and NAIS for males, some HPV vaccines are licensed for use in males to protect them from being infected and spreading the HPV virus.

keywords: Tropicamide,Mydriacyl,
```

## What is this medication for?

Tropicamide belongs to a class of medications called mydriatics, which dilate the pupil to make it bigger. It is also a cycloplegic agent (medication that relaxes the eye muscles which help the eye to focus).

Tropicamide eye drop may be used to dilate your eyes before an eye examination or a surgery. Doctors may prescribe tropicamide eye drop to children before a spectacle degree test (refraction test) so that the spectacle degree test is most accurate.

It may also be used to relieve pain caused by eye inflammation. Hence, it is used often in post-surgery cases or in uveitis (inflammation of the middle layer of the eye).

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   Proper use of eye drop
    
    *   Wash your hands with soap and water, and read the instructions on the label.
        
    *   Tilt your head backwards and look up.
        
    *   Gently pull the lower eyelid down to form a pocket and squeeze the bottle to apply one drop into your eye. To prevent the tip of the bottle from getting dirty, make sure the tip does not touch the eye or any other surface.
        
    *   Keep your eyes closed and press down gently on the inner corner of your eye for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the medication to be absorbed.
        
    *   If you need to use more than 1 drop of medication, or if you are using another type of eye drop, wait at least 5 to 10 minutes before applying the next eye drop. This is to prevent the first drop of medication from being washed away by the second drop of medication before it has time to work. This also prevents any medication interactions between different eye drops.
        
    *   If your doctor prescribed both eye drops and eye ointments, you should use the eye drops first.
        
    *   Click on this link for a step-by-step guide on how to apply eye drops [https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/A-Step-By-Step-Guide-On-How-To-Instil-Eye-Drops](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/A-Step-By-Step-Guide-On-How-To-Instil-Eye-Drops)

title: Sodium chloride 5% Eye Preparations
url_slug: Sodium-chloride-5-Eye-Preparations
keywords: Sodium Chloride,Visinic,Antiedema,Oftalmolosa Cusi,
```

## What is this medication for?

Sodium chloride 5% (also known as highly concentrated saline) eye preparations reduce/treat cornea swelling (edema). The cornea is the front, transparent part of the eye. When fluid builds up within the cornea, the swelling causes clouding of the cornea. This leads to blurry vision, and for some patients, they may also see halos around street lights or car headlights especially at night. Sodium chloride 5% helps to draw out fluid from the cornea to reduce swelling and relieve such symptoms.

Cornea swelling may occur due to surgery or in cornea disorders such as bullous keratopathy or Fuch’s dystrophy.

keywords: Herpes zoster,Shingrix,Zostavax,
```

## ​What is the Shingles Vaccine Used For?

Shingles vaccines help prevent shingles caused by the Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV). VZV is the same virus that causes chickenpox. It stays dormant in your body and can cause shingles later in life. Though shingles cannot spread directly from one person to another, the VZV can spread and cause chickenpox in those who never had chickenpox or had never received the chickenpox vaccine .Transmission of the VZV is through direct contact with fluid from the shingles rash blisters.People with shingles cannot spread the VZV before their rash blisters appear or after the rash has crusted.

  

The first symptom of shingles is usually pain, which can be intense with even a slightest touch. Other symptoms of shingles include rash, fluid filled blisters, fever, headache, chills, or stomach upset. 

  

A common complication of shingles, especially in older adults is a nerve pain, called postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), which can be severe and long-lasting, even after the rash has cleared. Other rare complications include lung infection (pneumonia), brain inflammation (encephalitis), hearing loss or blindness.

  

## What Are the Types of Shingles Vaccine Available?

There are two types of vaccines available:

1.  Recombinant Shingles Vaccine
2.  Live Shingles Vaccine 

The recombinant shingles vaccine does not contain the live VZV, but contains the shingles “code” for the body to recognise and obtain immunity from. The live shingles vaccine contains the weakened VZV.   

  

## Who Should Receive the Shingles Vaccine?  

It is recommended in older adults, such as those 50 years of age or older who would benefit from immunity to shingles. Please check with your doctor for more information.

```

## ​What is the HiB Vaccine Used For?

HiB vaccines help to prevent infection caused by the bacteria, Haemophilus Influenzae type B.

  

HiB disease tends to affect children below 5 years of age. It can cause many different kinds of infections, ranging from mild illnesses, such as ear infections or bronchitis, to severe illnesses, such as pneumonia, infections of the bloodstream or brain/spinal cord (meningitis), sometimes leading to death. 

  

It is spread from one person to another through close contact or the air, via coughs or sneezes. People who are not sick but have the bacteria in their noses and throats can still spread the bacteria.

  

Symptoms of HiB infection depend on the site of infection. In pneumonia where the lungs are affected, symptoms include shortness of breath, cough and fever. In meningitis where the brain/spinal cord are affected, symptoms include sudden onset of irritability, vomiting, poor appetite, or becoming inactive.

  

## Who Should Receive the HiB Vaccine?

As part of the Singapore National Childhood Immunisation Schedule (NCIS), all children should receive three doses and a booster at appropriate intervals, for example at age 2, 4, 6 months old, followed by a booster dose at age 18 months old.

  

It is also recommended in adults who are at risk of invasive HiB infection, such as those without a functional spleen, who suffer from immunodeficiencies, or those receiving chemotherapy.

  

## What Precautions Should I Follow Before Receiving the HiB Vaccine?

Inform your healthcare professional if your child:

*   Is allergic to this vaccine or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine 
*   Had shown signs of an allergic reaction to the previous dose of the vaccine
*   Is taking any other medications
*   Is currently not feeling well and having a fever
*   Has a history of bleeding disorders  
    

## How Is the HiB Vaccine Given?

It is given by injection into a muscle.  

  

Under the NCIS, the HiB vaccine is given in combination with other vaccines (e.g. Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, Polio, with/without Hepatitis B) as one shot. Please consult your child’s doctor for more details.

##   

## What Are Some Common Side Effects of the HiB Vaccine?

*   Pain, redness and swelling at the injection site 

*   You may place a cold compress over the affected area for relief

```

## ​What is the DTaP/Tdap Vaccine Used For?  

DTaP/Tdap vaccines help to prevent diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis.  Diphtheria and pertussis are infectious diseases which spread from one person to another through the air, via coughs or sneezes. Tetanus is not easily spread from person to person but is a serious disease affecting the nerves, and enters the body through cuts or wounds. 

Diphtheria - Diphtheria bacteria causes breathing difficulties, problems with swallowing, heart failure, paralysis, and death.

Tetanus - Tetanus bacteria produce a toxin that causes “lockjaw” resulting in painful muscle contractions, which interferes with breathing and swallowing, leading to death.  

Pertussis - Pertussis bacteria cause uncontrollable, violent coughing (“whooping cough”) which results in breathing difficulties, as well as problems in eating or drinking.

## What Are the Types of DTaP/Tdap Vaccine Available?  

There are two types of vaccines available, which differ in their diphtheria and pertussis content:

1.  DTaP: Diphtheria, Tetanus, and acellular Pertussis 
    
2.  Tdap: Tetanus, reduced diphtheria and acellular pertussis content

url_slug: hormone-replacement-therapy
keywords: Premarin,Estrofem,Progynova,Activelle,Femoston,Trisequens,Progyluton,estrogen,Progestogen,
```

## What is this medication for?  

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is used to describe preparations that contain the two female hormones, estrogen and progestogen, that are given together to relieve bothersome symptoms of menopause. 

  

Symptoms of menopause include hot face, neck and chest (“hot flushes”), night sweats, vaginal dryness and low mood. The decrease in estrogen may also lead to a condition called osteoporosis, where the bones become thinner, weaker and easier to break. Using estrogen alone may cause abnormal thickening of the uterus (womb) lining – hence those with an intact uterus require an additional female hormone, progestogen, to prevent this. 

  

Progestogen may be combined together with estrogen in one tablet. It may also be prescribed separately for a specific duration each month  

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.
*   You should take this medication after food.

There are different types of HRTs and the way to take these medications depends on the HRT that you have been prescribed. Some brands have different coloured tablets which have to be taken in a certain order.

*   **Estrogen only HRT e.g.  Premarin® / Estrofem® / Progynova®**

*   You should take one tablet daily without break, preferably at the same time every day.
*   If you have an intact uterus and are still menstruating, your doctor would prescribe a separate progestogen hormone as well to take for a specific duration (usually 10 – 14 days) each month. In this case, you will experience a withdrawal bleed (menses) after finishing the progestogen tablets.   
    

*   **Continuous combined therapy e.g. Activelle®, Femoston® Conti 1/5** 

*   You should take one tablet daily without break, preferably at the same time every day.  
    

*   **Continuous Estrogen and Cyclic Progestogen Therapy e.g. Femoston® 1/10 and Femoston® 2/10**

*   These types of medications usually have 14 tablets containing estrogen only, and 14 tablets containing estrogen and progestogen, in one pack. 
    
*   You must take the tablets in the correct order.
    
*   Take one tablet daily without break, preferably at the same time every day.

## What is the MMR Vaccine Used For?  

MMR vaccines help to prevent measles, mumps, and rubella. MMR vaccines contain weakened live viruses, but are not able to cause measles, mumps or rubella in healthy people.   

  

Measles, mumps, and rubella are infectious diseases that spread easily from one person to another through the air and can lead to serious complications.   

  

Measles - Measles virus causes rash, cough, runny nose, eye irritation, and fever. It can lead to ear infection, pneumonia (lung infection), seizures (jerking and staring), brain damage, and death. 

  

Mumps - Mumps virus causes fever, headache, muscle pain, loss of appetite, and swollen salivary glands. It can lead to deafness, meningitis (infection of the brain and spinal cord covering), painful swelling of the testicles or ovaries, and rarely sterility (not able to produce children).   

  

Rubella (German Measles) - Rubella virus causes rash, arthritis (mostly in women) and mild fever. If a woman gets rubella during pregnancy, it may lead to miscarriage or birth defects in the newborn.

url_slug: Bacillus-Calmette-Guerin-BCG-Vaccine
keywords: BCG,
```

## ​What is the BCG Vaccine Used For?

Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccines help to prevent tuberculosis (TB), especially in areas where the disease is endemic (widespread). The BCG vaccine is highly effective in preventing serious forms of childhood TB, such as TB meningitis (inflammation of the covering around the brain or spinal cord) and disseminated TB (spread of TB infection from the lungs to multiple organs).

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria known as _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. It is spread from one person to another through droplets released into the air, such as by coughing or sneezing.

Common symptoms of TB include cough lasting three weeks or longer, coughing out blood, feeling tired, fever, night sweats and unexplained or unintentional weight loss.

## Who Should Receive the BCG Vaccine?  

The BCG vaccine is routinely given in Singapore to newborns soon after birth, as recommended under the [National Childhood Immunisation Schedule (NCIS)](https://ch-api.healthhub.sg/api/public/content/92acf90a36e747fbaf9bd1ce9b5cdaba?v=cb7aea7c).  

  

It may also be considered for adults who have not been previously infected or are unvaccinated, but are at a higher risk of contracting TB. These include those with risk of exposure from work, such as healthcare/long-term care facilities personnel, prison personnel or workers exposed to cattle or monkeys. Mantoux testing (a test to check if one is infected with TB) is recommended before vaccination to confirm lack of current or previous TB infection.

## What Precautions Should I Follow Before Receiving the BCG Vaccine?  

Inform your healthcare professional if:

*   You/your child are allergic to this vaccine or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine
    
*   You are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding
    
*   You/your child are taking any other medications
    
*   You/your child have a weak immune system due to an illness such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection or cancer
    
*   You/your child are currently on treatment which weakens your/their immune system such as medications (e.g. steroids) or radiation therapy to the bone marrow
    
*   You/your child are currently not feeling well and having a fever
    
*   You/your child have a skin infection that affects the whole body
    
*   You/your child have recently received any other vaccines
    

## How Is the BCG Vaccine Given?

It is given by injection into the skin.  

One dose is given to newborns soon after birth as part of the NCIS. The vaccination is usually offered while your baby is still in hospital.

If your baby was unable to receive the BCG vaccination while still in the hospital, BCG vaccination is offered as one dose for children up to 5 years of age (i.e. <6 years). Children aged 6 months or older are required to undergo Mantoux testing before vaccination.

It is also administered as one dose for adults who are not previously infected or are unvaccinated, but are at a higher risk of contracting TB.

## What Are Some Common Side Effects of the BCG Vaccine?

For newborns

*   Pain, redness and swelling at the injection site   
    
    *   You may place a cold compress over the affected area for relief

keywords: Hepatitis B,Engerix,
```

## ​What is the Hepatitis B Vaccine Used For?

Hepatitis B vaccines help to prevent infection caused by the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV).  

  

Hepatitis B can lead to serious liver disease, and is spread by direct contact with blood or other body fluids from an infected person. It can also spread by sharing items such as toothbrushes or razors with an infected person.  A baby whose mother is infected may become infected at birth unless the necessary vaccines are given.

  

Common symptoms of Hepatitis B include jaundice (yellowing of skin or eyes), nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and joint pain.

  

## Who Should Receive the Hepatitis B Vaccine?

As part of the Singapore National Childhood Immunisation Schedule (NCIS), all children should receive three doses at appropriate intervals. Infants should get their first dose at birth and will usually complete the series by 6 months of age, however sometimes it may take longer than 6 months to complete the series.

  

As part of the Singapore National Adult Immunisation Schedule (NAIS), adults (18 years or older) who have not been previously vaccinated, or lack evidence of past infection or immunity should receive three doses (the first dose, followed by the second and third dose at one month and six months after the first dose).

  

## What Precautions Should I Follow Before Receiving the Hepatitis B Vaccine?

Under the NCIS, the Hepatitis B vaccine may be given on its own as one shot, or in combination with other vaccines (e.g. Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, Polio and Hib) as one shot.

  

A booster dose may be required in certain patients with specific medical conditions such as kidney problems (e.g. on haemodialysis) or a weak immune system.

## What is this medication for?

Brimonidine belongs to a class of medications called alpha-adrenergic agonists, which is used to treat glaucoma.

Brimonidine helps to lower the pressure in your eye by reducing production and increasing drainage of fluid in the eye.

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   Proper use of eye drop

*   Wash your hands with soap and water, and read the instructions on the label.
*   Tilt your head backwards and look up.
*   Gently pull the lower eyelid down to form a pocket and squeeze the bottle to apply one drop into your eye. To prevent the tip of the bottle from getting dirty, make sure the tip does not touch the eye or any other surface.
*   Close your eyes gently and wipe off any excess eye drops around your eyes with a clean tissue.
*   Keep your eyes closed and press down gently on the inner corner of your eye for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the medication to be absorbed.
*   If you need to use more than 1 drop of medication, or if you are using another type of eye drop, wait at least 5 to 10 minutes before applying the next eye drop. This is to prevent the first drop of medication from being washed away by the second drop before it has time to work. This also prevents any medication interactions between different eye drops.
*   If your doctor prescribed both eye drops and eye ointments, you should use the eye drops first. 
*   Click on this link for a step-by-step guide on how to apply eye drops [https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/A-Step-By-Step-Guide-On-How-To-Instil-Eye-Drops](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/A-Step-By-Step-Guide-On-How-To-Instil-Eye-Drops)

*   Remove your contact lens before each application of medication.
*   When using hard lens, you can put them on directly after applying the eye drops.
*   When using soft lens, you can put them on 30 minutes after applying the eye drops. Otherwise, your lens may be damaged by the preservatives present in the eye drops.
*   If you need to apply eye drops twice a day, it is recommended that you apply them once in the morning before you put on your lens, and at the end of the day after you remove your lens.

title: Ear Wax Impaction
url_slug: Ear-Wax-Impaction
keywords: Ear drops,olive oil,glycerin,mineral oil,ear syringing,
```

## What is ear wax impaction?

Ear wax buildup and blockage may cause a feeling of pressure in the ear, dizziness, partial hearing of certain tones, ringing in the ears and ear discomfort. However, pain is not a usual symptom of ear wax buildup and blockage.

If the ear wax is large enough to fully block your ear canal, you may experience hearing loss. This usually happens over a period of time. Ear wax buildup and blockage can happen to one, or both ears.

## What are the possible causes of this condition?

Ear wax is produced inside the ear canal by the glands just under the skin. It is responsible for lubricating the ear canal, preventing dust and bacteria from entering the middle ear. Normal ear wax will move towards the outer part of the ear canal and gets removed naturally from the ears.

If the ear wax builds up and hardens or becomes firmly lodged in the ear canal, it can cause partial or total blockage. The ear wax can expand when it comes into contact with water, which blocks up the ear canal. This can happen after a shower or swim.

Sometimes, your ear wax gets pushed deeper into the ear when cotton buds are used to clean your ear. Wearing hearing aids, ear plugs or in-ear phones for long periods of time worsen this issue and can cause ear wax impaction.

## What are the symptoms of ear wax impaction?

The symptoms of this condition can include the following:

*   Sensation of plugged ears or ear fullness
    
*   Hearing loss
    
*   Ringing in the ears
    
*   Ear itch
    
*   Dizziness
    
*   Dry cough
    
*   Ear pain (uncommon)
    

## What can I do to treat ear wax impaction?

Ear wax impaction can be treated in the following ways and you can approach your pharmacist to get the following medications.

*   Olive oil ear drops
    
*   Mineral oil ear drops
    
*   Docusate sodium ear drops
    
*   Hydrogen peroxide ear drops
    
*   Glycerol ear drops
    
*   Saline solution
    

## When do I need to see a doctor?

Although ear wax can be treated without a doctor’s consultation, there are times where the condition might be more serious.

If your condition does not get better after 5 days of treatment with ear drops or gets worse, you should see a doctor. You should also see a doctor if you experience any of the following:

*   Abnormal ear discharge e.g. blood or pus
    
*   Severe, sharp ear pain
    
*   Severe itch in ear
    
*   Dizziness or vertigo
    

You should not treat ear wax impaction by yourself if you have a history of perforated eardrums or have had ear surgery before.

## What else can I do to manage this condition?

Other than using medications to treat the condition, ear wax impaction can also be managed by the following methods:

*   Use ear cleaning products that you can buy over the counter

title: Allergic Rhinitis
url_slug: Allergic-Rhinitis
keywords: allergic rhinitis,medication,medicine,Drug,PIL,
```

## What is allergic rhinitis?

Allergic rhinitis (AR), is a condition affecting up to 13.1% of the Singapore population, characterised by nasal symptoms triggered off by substances known as allergens.

## How does allergic rhinitis occur?

*   Allergens present in the environment, both indoors and outdoors can trigger the symptoms of AR.
    
*   The immune system would treat these allergens as foreign substances, hence releasing large amounts of chemicals in the body that mediate inflammation, leading to the symptoms.
    
*   Examples of common allergens include:
    
    *   Dust mites
        
    *   Animal/Pet dander
        
    *   Insect droppings
        
    *   Mould
        
    *   Pollen
        

## What are the symptoms?

*   Sneezing that is sudden and happens repeatedly
    
*   Runny nose with clear discharge
    
*   Itchy nose
    
*   Blocked nose
    
*   Cough due to post-nasal drip
    
*   Allergic conjunctivitis (red, itchy, tearing and/or burning of eyes)
    

## What are the treatment options?

Depending on the severity of the symptoms, some examples include:

### Non-Drowsy Antihistamines

They are used to relieve symptoms such as runny nose, itchy nose and sneezing. They are typically used for milder cases where symptoms do not occur frequently or do not last long.

Some antihistamines are combined with a decongestant which gives additional relief of blocked nose. They should not be used for prolonged periods to manage AR.

### Steroid Nasal Sprays

They are most effective in reducing moderate symptoms associated with AR. They work best when used continuously and the maximum effect is usually seen in 2 weeks.

### Decongestant Nasal Spray

Decongestant sprays are useful in relieving blocked nose. They should be limited to NOT more than 3-5 days due to potential worsening of the symptoms once the medication is stopped.

### Eyedrops

Antihistamine eyedrops provide fast relief of itchy watery eyes.

Some antihistamine eyedrops are combined with a decongestant to help reduce eye redness. Such preparations should be limited to NOT more than 3-5 days to prevent symptoms from worsening once the medication is stopped.

### Saline Nasal Wash

The nasal washes are a drug-free option to remove allergens and clear blocked nasal passages.

Isotonic washes are used for cleaning the nose and may be used daily. Hypertonic washes clear blocked nasal passages and used for the short term.

## How else can I manage allergic rhinitis?

*   Avoidance of allergens is the best management once it is identified.
    
*   Cleaning methods like vacuuming and mopping may be used to keep the house clean, significantly reducing allergies.
    
*   Control quality of air in the home by using air purifiers that contain HEPA filters. Keep a low humidity and ensure good ventilation to prevent mould formation.
    
*   Bed sheets should be washed with hot water weekly and allergen-proof sheets used for pillows and mattresses.
    
*   If there are any pets at home, they should be kept out of the bedroom and off the furniture.
    

## Do I need to see a doctor?

Please consult a doctor when you experience any of the following:

*   Wheezing and/or shortness of breath
    
*   Persistent fever (>37.5°C)
    
*   Signs and symptoms of sinus or ear infection e.g. Yellow/greenish discharge from the nose/ear or sinus/ear pain
    
*   No improvement after 3 months of continuous usage of steroid nasal sprays
    
*   Worsening of allergy symptoms despite self-care
    
*   Severe allergy symptoms that affect your quality of life, persisting past 4 weeks
    

## Can allergic rhinitis be cured?

Children in particular, may outgrow the allergy as the immune system becomes less sensitive to the allergen. However, once exposed to the allergen, allergies tend to have long-term effect on the person. Nevertheless, most cases of AR can be effectively managed.

title: Malaria
url_slug: Malaria
keywords: doxycycline,Malarone,Mefloquine,Atovaquone,Proguanil,
```

## What is Malaria?

Malaria is a disease caused by a malaria parasite called _Plasmodium_. There are five species of _Plasmodium_ and any of these can cause malaria. It spreads to humans commonly through the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito.

Although uncommon, malaria can also spread through

*   Pregnancy: from mother to the unborn child
    
*   Transfusion of blood infected with malaria
    
*   Contact with an infected person’s blood e.g. through sharing of hypodermic needles by drug abusers
    

The disease is found most often in tropical countries, particularly in the less developed areas. In some countries, the city areas might be free from malaria while it might be common in other parts of the country.

The risk of infection for travellers will be different depending on the area within the country they will be travelling to and the types of activities they will be doing.

## What are the symptoms of malaria?

The symptoms of this condition can include the following:

*   High fever (more than 38.5⁰C)
    
*   Chills with uncontrollable shivering and excessive sweating
    
*   Headache
    
*   Muscle ache
    
*   Tiredness or weakness
    
*   Jaundice (yellow eyes and skin) in some cases
    
*   Confusion / coma
    

Malaria symptoms can develop as early as 7 days after you first get exposed to the parasite. It can also develop as late as a few months after you leave the area where malaria is present.

Hence, it is important to know that any illness that happens within one year and especially within three months after you return might be malaria, even if you followed all recommended steps to prevent malaria. If you develop any illness, especially within three months of your return from your trip, you should see a doctor immediately and inform your doctor that you went to a country where malaria is present.

## What can I take to prevent malaria?

Malaria can be prevented in the following ways and you can approach your pharmacist to get the following medication.

*   Atovaquone / Proguanil (Malarone®)
    

Medications to prevent malaria do not offer complete protection and you should still prevent yourself from getting bitten by mosquitoes.

## What else can I do to manage this condition?

General protection is the most important step to prevent malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases. As Anopheles mosquitoes are more active at night, the malaria parasite would be passed on to the humans mainly between sunset and sunrise. Therefore, it is important to take steps to reduce contact with mosquitoes, especially during these hours.

Other than using medications to prevent the condition, malaria can also be prevented by the following methods:

*   Wear long-sleeved shirts and long trousers to cover most parts of your body
    
*   Use insect repellents which contain more than 30% DEET (diethyltoluamide) on exposed skin. For children, do not use products that contain more than 30% DEET.
    
*   Do not apply insect repellent to children less than 2 months old. Instead, you can use mosquito nettings over the strollers or baby carrier when you go to areas where your baby may be exposed to mosquitoes
    
*   Burn mosquito coils or hang a mosquito net over your bed when sleeping, making sure the edges are tucked in.
    
*   Spray insecticide where the mosquitoes may rest. Mosquito larvae survive well in clear, slow-flowing streams.
    
*   Avoid going to an area where malaria is common

keywords: gemfibrozil,Brozil,
```

## What is this medication for?

Gemfibrozil belongs to the class of medications called fibrates. Fibrates work by speeding the natural processes that remove cholesterol from the body. They lower the amount of ‘fat’ (triglyceride) and ‘bad cholesterol’ (low density lipoprotein or LDL-cholesterol) as well as increase the amount of ‘good cholesterol’ (high density lipoprotein or HDL-cholesterol) in the blood.

High ‘bad cholesterol’ levels can cause your blood vessels to clog up and lead to chest pain (angina), heart attack or stroke. Hence, fibrates may reduce your risk for heart attack and stroke.

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional. If you stop taking your medication, your cholesterol level may rise again.
    
*   This medicine should be taken before food, on an empty stomach.
    
*   If you are taking cholestyramine or colestipol, take it 4 to 6 hours before or 1 hour after gemfibrozil.
    

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose. Then take your next dose at the usual time. Do not take two doses to make up for the missed dose.

title: Motion Sickness
url_slug: Motion-Sickness
keywords: Dimenhydrinate,Cinnarizine,promethazine,Novomin®,Motion sickness,
```

## What is motion sickness?

Motion sickness is a condition that causes nausea and dizziness. It may happen to people when they are on a boat, in a car, on a carnival ride or in other moving vehicles.

  

## What are the possible causes of this condition?

Motion sickness occurs when your body’s sensory organs sends mixed or different messages to your brain 

  

Movement is sensed by the brain and it receives signals from

*   The inner ear, which provides information to the brain about movement, speed and gravity
*   The eyes, which provides sight
*   The muscles and joints, which senses the position of different body parts compared to other parts of the body

When the body is moved on purpose, for example when we walk, the signals received from the ear, eye and body tissues match what our brain senses.   

However, when there is unintentional movement of the body, signals from the eye, ear and body tissues might not match each other. For example, imagine yourself inside the room of a moving ship. Your eyes do not sense movement, but your ears sense movement due to the motion of the ship. The difference in the signal that the eyes and ears send to the brain may cause motion sickness. 

  

## What are the symptoms of motion sickness?

The symptoms of this condition can include the following:

*   Dizziness 
*   Nausea or vomiting  
    
*   Loss of appetite
*   Increased saliva production
*   Feeling warm 
*   Cold sweats
*   Headache
*   Pale skin
*   Fast, shallow breathing
*   Drowsiness

  

## What can I do to treat motion sickness?

Motion sickness can be treated in the following ways and you can approach your pharmacist to get the following medications. 

*   Cinnarizine
*   Dimenhydrinate
*   Promethazine

These medications can also help to prevent motion sickness. In general, they work best if you take them at least 30 minutes before your journey.

  

## When do I need to see a doctor?

Although motion sickness can be treated without a doctor’s consultation, there are times where the condition might be more serious. 

If your condition does not get better in 24 hours or gets worse, you should see a doctor. You should also see a doctor if you experience any of the following:

*   Nausea or vomiting that continues even after you leave the moving vehicle
*   Symptoms of motion sickness that happens even when you are not in a moving vehicle
*   Hearing loss
*   Chest pain  
    
*   Signs of dehydration

  

## What else can I do to manage this condition?

Other than using medications to treat the condition, motion sickness can also be managed by the following methods:

*   You can try lying on your back, closing your eyes or looking at the horizon
*   Ginger has been used traditionally to prevent motion sickness. However, ginger may increase the risk of bleeding, especially if you also take blood-thinners such as warfarin or aspirin, so check with your healthcare provider before using ginger supplements.
*   You can try applying pressure at the P6 acupressure point on the inside of the wrist, either by applying pressure manually or with an acupressure wrist band. The P6 acupressure point is located three finger breadths below the wrist on the inner arm in between the two tendons (shown by the tip of the pen below).

The following are some suggestions to prevent motion sickness from happening again:

*   Keep your eyes on the outside world while you are in a moving vehicle. This helps to match what you see, to the movement you are feeling, and makes you less likely to feel sick 

*   If you are in a car or bus, sit in front and face forward
*   If you are on a boat, stay on the deck and look to the horizon. 
*   If you are in a train or plane, choose window seats

*   Avoid reading, looking at a screen, or looking at things close to you while you are inside a moving vehicle
*   Stay hydrated by drinking water. Avoid alcohol or caffeinated drinks  
    
*   Eat small, frequent meals  
    
*   Breathe in fresh air
*   Avoid smoking or smokers
*   Use ginger supplements, such as ginger candy, ginger ale, candied or raw ginger

## What is allergic conjunctivitis?

Allergic conjunctivitis is a condition that affects the eyes and this usually happens when you are allergic to things that irritate your eyes.

When your eyes are exposed to the allergen, they may become red, itchy and watery.

## What are the possible causes of this condition?

Allergic conjunctivitis is caused by allergens that come in contact with the eyes.

When allergens, which are substances that cause an allergic reaction, come into contact with your eyes, your immune system would treat them as foreign substances and release large amounts of chemicals. This causes inflammation of the eyes and leads to the symptoms.

Examples of common allergens include:

*   Dust mites
    
*   Dust or wood dust
    
*   Animal or pet fur
    
*   Pollen

## What is this medication for?

Fenofibrate belongs to the class of medications called fibrates. Fibrates work by speeding the natural processes that remove cholesterol from the body. They lower the amount of ‘fat’ (triglyceride) and ‘bad cholesterol’ (low density lipoprotein or LDL-cholesterol) as well as increase the amount of ‘good cholesterol’ (high density lipoprotein or HDL-cholesterol) in the blood.

High ‘bad cholesterol’ levels can cause your blood vessels to clog up and lead to chest pain (angina), heart attack or stroke. Hence, fibrates may reduce your risk for heart attack and stroke.

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional. If you stop taking your medication, your cholesterol level may rise again.

*   Ask your healthcare professional if you are unsure whether to take your medication with food or without food.
    
*   If you are taking cholestyramine or colestipol, take it 4 to 6 hours before or 1 hour after fenofibrate.
    

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose. Then take your next dose at the usual time. Do not take two doses to make up for the missed dose.

keywords: Dropsera,Yaz,
```

## What is this medication for?  

Combined hormonal contraceptives contain two types of female hormones, estrogen and progestogen. This medication can help prevent ovulation and regulates other naturally occurring hormones in the body. When taken correctly, this prevents pregnancy and promotes regular menstrual bleeding. 

  

There are typically two types of regimens depending on the medication you are prescribed.

  

**This leaflet describes the combined hormonal contraceptives with a 28-day regimen**, which includes:  

*   Drospirenone 3mg, Ethinylestradiol 20mcg (e.g. Yaz®, Drospera®)  
    

## How should I take/use this medication?  

*   Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.
*   If you are switching from other forms of contraception, please seek advice from your healthcare professional.
*   You should take this medication after food.
*   You may start taking this medication on the first or second day of your menses (if this is your first time taking hormonal contraceptives).
*   If you are also using it for contraceptive purposes, a barrier method of contraception e.g. condoms, is recommended for the first 7 days of taking this medication for the first time.
*   Each pack contains 24 pink (active) tablets and 4 white (inactive) tablets = 28 tablets.  
    
*   You should take one tablet daily for 28 days in a row, preferably at the same time every day. You must take the tablets in the correct sequence i.e. start each pack with the pink (active) tablets, followed by the white (inactive) tablets. 
*   The next pack is started after the last tablet of the previous pack. Withdrawal bleeding (menses) usually starts on day 2 – 3 after the last white (inactive) tablet is taken and may not have finished before the next pack is started.  
    

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

There is no action needed if you have missed the white (inactive) tablets; however you must follow the steps below if you miss any of your 24 pink (active) tablets to ensure that the contraceptive effect is not reduced.  

  

**Within 24 hours:**

Take the missed tablet as soon as remembered, then continue taking the next one at your usual time.  

  

**More than 24 hours:**

If the missed tablet is within

*   **Week 3 of the pack:**  

Depending on whether you have taken your tablets correctly in the 7 days before the first missed tablet, you would have to follow the following options:

Your menses may not come until you finish taking all the pink (active) tablets of the next pack, but there is no need to worry. However, if your menses do not occur after the next pack is finished, you should take a pregnancy test to make sure you are not pregnant.

**OR**

Stop the current pack and have a tablet-free period of up to 4 days (including the day you missed the tablet) – during which time a withdrawal bleed (menses) usually occurs and then continue with the next pack.

However, the formation of blood clot is rare and the doctor would have considered the risks against the benefits before making the recommendation.   

  

The symptoms of blood clot may include one or more of the following:

*   Any unusual sudden cough, breathlessness or difficulty in breathing 
*   Severe pain in the chest which may reach the left arm
*   Severe pain in legs or swelling in either of your legs
*   Weakness or numbness in any part of your body
*   Change in your speech, including slurring of words
*   Change in your senses of hearing, smell or taste
*   Vision changes such as loss of vision or blurred vision 

Other rare but serious effects include: 

*   Unusual, severe or long lasting headache or worsening of migraine 
*   Dizziness or fainting
*   Severe pain in your abdomen
*   Dark urine or light coloured stools
*   Nausea and vomiting
*   Loss of appetite
*   Yellowing of eyes or skin  
    

If you experience any of these symptoms, you should stop your medication and see your healthcare professional immediately.

The normal bowel movement is different from individual to individual and can range from two to three times a day to three times a week. If you notice a decrease in your frequency of bowel movement or have difficulty having a bowel movement, this can be considered constipation.

## What are the possible causes of this condition?

Constipation can be caused by a variety of reasons such as:

*   Not having enough water or fluids
    
*   Not having enough fibre in your diet
    
*   Lack of regular exercise
    
*   Not emptying your bowels when you feel the urge to pass motion
    
*   Medical conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, pregnancy or cancer
    
*   Use of certain medications such as
    
    *   Supplements like calcium or iron
        
    *   Medications for your heart or blood pressure like Nifedipine or Verapamil
        
    *   Medications for stomach problems like antacids
        
*   Change in your diet, daily routine or lifestyle
    
*   Stress
    

## What are the symptoms of constipation?

The symptoms of this condition can include the following:

*   Difficulty passing stools
    
*   Passing small, hard or dry stools
    
*   Feeling bloated

*   Bisacodyl Tablets or Suppositories
    
*   Fleet Enema
    
*   Glycerin Suppository and Gel

*   Senna Tablets
    
*   Macrogol powder
    
*   Forlax powder
    

## When do I need to see a doctor?

Although constipation can be treated without a doctor’s consultation, there are times where the condition might be more serious.

If your condition does not get better in a week or gets worse, you should see a doctor. You should also see a doctor if you experience any of the following:

*   Fever
    
*   Nausea and/or vomiting
    
*   Black or sticky stools
    
*   Blood in the stools
    
*   Very bad stomach pain or cramping
    
*   Very bad stomach wind
    
*   Sudden changes in bowel habits, especially if you also have weight loss
    
*   Changes in the type/texture of stools
    
*   No appetite to eat
    
*   History of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), a medical condition that causes inflammation in your intestines, causing pain, cramping and weight loss
    
*   Constipation alternating with diarrhoea
    
*   Needing to use constipation medicine regularly (for example, every 2-3 days or more often)
    
*   Liquid or soft stools leak out of your anus
    

## What else can I do to manage this condition?

Other than using medications to treat the condition, constipation can also be managed by the following methods:

*   Increase your intake of fluids
    
*   Increase your intake of fibre in your diet to encourage bowel movement. However, remember to drink more water, otherwise your constipation might become worse.
    

The following are some suggestions to prevent constipation from happening again:

*   Have more fibre in your diet. Examples include vegetables, fruits, cereals and wholegrain breads. You should aim for about 25-30g of fibre every day to encourage bowel movement
    
*   Increase the amount of fluids you drink. You should aim for at least six to eight cups of fluid or water a day
    
*   Exercise regularly
    
*   Empty your bowels whenever you feel the urge to pass motion
    
*   Your sitting position on the toilet can affect bowel function. It is best to lean forward with a straight back, and with feet flat or on a foot stool, so that the knees are above the hips.
    
*   Check with your doctor or pharmacist if any of your long term medications can cause constipation and if you can be given another medication instead

keywords: Isosorbide mononitrate,ISMN,
```

## ​What is this medication for?

Isosorbide 5-Mononitrate Controlled Release (ISMN CR) belongs to a class of medications called Nitrates. Nitrates are used to prevent and treat the symptoms of angina (chest pain). Angina is caused by lack of blood supply and oxygen to your heart. Nitrates work by relaxing blood vessels so that more blood and oxygen is supplied to the heart.

  

When you take this medication regularly on a long-term basis, it can help to treat angina by reducing the number of heart attacks that occur.

  

Nitrates can also be used with other medications for the treatment of heart failure, a condition where the heart is weak and is unable to pump enough blood to the rest of the body.

  

## How should I take/use this medication?  

*   Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional. Stopping your medication suddenly may cause angina attacks. Ask your doctor for recommendations on how to reduce the dose slowly before stopping completely.
*   You may take this medication with or without food. The medication may be halved, but do not crush or chew the tablets.
*   This medication is used to reduce the number of angina attacks that occur. They should not be used for immediate relief for chest pain.  
    

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

If you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, take only the usual dose. Do not double your dose or use extra medication to make up for the missed dose. 

  

## What precautions should I take?

Inform your healthcare professional if: 

*   You are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication
*   You are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding   
    

## What are some common side-effects of this medication?  

Side effects may include:

*   Dizziness, lightheadedness or faintness

*   This may occur especially when you get up quickly from lying or sitting down. Getting up slowly or changing posture slowly may help. Take a rest by sitting or lying down if you feel dizzy.
*   This is also more likely to happen if you drink alcohol, stand for a long period of time, exercise or when the weather is hot. Do limit the amount of alcohol you drink while you are on Nitrates. Do take extra care during exercise, when the weather is hot or if you need to stand for long periods of time.

*   Temporary headache

*   This is a common side effect that will go away after taking the medication for a while. You may choose to take painkillers such as Paracetamol at the start of using Nitrates, to relieve the temporary headaches. Consult your healthcare professional if the headaches do not go away or become worse.

*   Flushing or redness of the skin
*   Fast heartbeat 
*   Nausea and Vomiting

Do not take Sildenafil (Viagra®), Tadalafil (Cialis®), Vardenafil (Levitra®) if you are taking this medication.

## What is this medication for?

**The following leaflet addresses the use of higher doses of amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav/amoxicillin-clavulanate in children when treating their infections.**

Both Amoxicillin and Co-amoxiclav/ Amoxicillin-Clavulanate contain amoxicillin as the active ingredient. Amoxicillin belongs to a group of antibiotics known as penicillin, and is used to treat a wide range of infections caused by bacteria, including infections of the chest (pneumonia), middle ear (otitis media), sinuses (sinusitis), tonsils (tonsillitis), urinary tract, and skin and soft tissue.

High-dose amoxicillin (such as 80 to 90mg/kg/day) is usually prescribed to overcome the antibiotic resistance that has developed to the common bacteria that may cause these infections such as the following:

*   Chest (pneumonia),
    
*   Ear (otitis media), and/or
    
*   Sinuses (sinusitis)
    

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   Amoxicillin or Co-amoxiclav/Amoxicillin-Clavulanate is usually taken two or three times a day.
    
*   You may take this medication after food to reduce stomach discomfort.

Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a recurrent, itchy skin condition that commonly affects children. Eczema is associated with a personal or family history of atopy, which is a group of disorders that include eczema, asthma and allergic rhinitis.

## What is Eczema?

Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a recurrent, itchy skin condition that commonly affects children. Eczema is associated with a personal or family history of atopy, which is a group of disorders that include eczema, asthma and [allergic rhinitis](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/Allergic-Rhinitis "allergic rhintitis").[\[1\]](#footnotes),[\[2\]](#footnotes)

## Symptoms of Eczema

Eczema symptoms can include intense itching, redness, small bumps and flaky, scaly skin. Children usually begin to experience these symptoms before the age of five. Appearance and location of eczema may differ depending on the age[\[3\]](#footnotes),[\[4\]](#footnotes):

1.  In babies, eczema tends to occur at the front of the arms and legs, cheeks and scalp. The diaper areas are usually not affected.
    
2.  In older children and adult, eczema occurs at the side of the neck, elbow creases and the back of knees. For adults, eczema tends to affect the face, wrist, hands and forearms. Also, the skin can darken and become thick. Scars can form from repeated scratching.
    

The affected area can become crusted. Excessive scratching may lead to infection, which appears as painful red bumps with pus.  

## Causes of Eczema

There is no known absolute cause. While the cause is not completely understood, genes involved in the formation of the skin barrier and the skin’s immune system may play a role in the development of eczema. In most people, eczema is caused by a genetic dysfunction in the outermost layer of the skin. Contrary to popular beliefs, eczema has not been proven to be associated with food allergies. See an allergy specialist if a food allergy is suspected in the child.

## Diagnosis

There are no diagnostic tests for eczema, and diagnosis is usually based on a person’s medical history and physical examination of the skin. A personal or family history of allergic conditions and appearance of symptoms at an early age can also help to confirm the diagnosis.

**Related: [Skin Disorders in Young Children](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/diseases-and-conditions/skin_disorders_in_young_children_nsc "Skin Disorders in Young Children I")**

## Treatment

Eczema is a chronic condition that fluctuates in terms of severity, where it sometimes improves and worsens. Some people can have no symptoms for many years. It cannot be cured, but symptoms can be controlled with moisturizers, topical and oral medicines, and self-care measures.

Below are some measures that can be taken to prevent eczema flare-ups:

### 1\. Avoiding Trigger Factors

Trigger factors include heat (overheating of the skin), perspiration and dry environment. Emotional stress or anxiety may also trigger eczema. Exposure to certain chemicals (e.g. soaps, detergents, perfumes, or cosmetics), materials (e.g. wool or synthetic fibres), dust, sand and smoke also may trigger a flare-up. It may take some effort and time to identify the trigger factors, but it is important to avoid such factors for long-term control of the condition.

### 2\. Keeping the Skin Moisturized and Hydrated

The skin can be kept hydrated with emollient cream and ointment formulations. They are best applied straight after bathing, and to be used as frequently as possible. While lotions contain more water and are more comfortable for application as compared to creams and ointments, the latter is better at retaining moisture in the skin.

In addition, take lukewarm baths or showers to hydrate and cool the skin. Use unscented, mild soap or soap-free cleansers. Avoid hot and long baths or showers (do not exceed 15 minutes). Bleach baths may be recommended for severe eczema with recurrent infections. Speak to your pharmacist about this.

### 3\. Topical and Oral Medications

When there is a flare-up with inflammation and itch, topical steroids may be used. Topical steroids of the right potency should be used for a short period of time to avoid side effects. It is important to apply a thin layer that is adequate to cover up the affected area. Oral antihistamines can also be given for a short period to relieve the itch. Do speak to your pharmacist about obtaining these medications.

**Related: [Desonide Cream or Lotion](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/Desonide-Cream-or-Lotion "Desonide Cream or Lotion")**

## Is there any special diet or supplement recommended for controlling or preventing eczema?

Probiotics with lactobacillus studied appear to be of limited benefit in improving symptoms[\[5\]](#footnotes). There is also conflicting evidence for probiotics use in preventing eczema in children with high risk.

Supplements like vitamins, fish oil and evening primrose oil appear to have limited evidence for effectiveness. The safety and efficacy of Chinese herbal medicine have also not been sufficiently evaluated in studies. Such supplements are not routinely recommended. Do check with your pharmacists for more information regarding these supplements.

## What is this medication for?  

Riociguat is used to treat high blood pressure in the lungs, known as pulmonary hypertension. More specifically, it can help treat a subgroup of pulmonary hypertension patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH).

Riociguat is a type of medication called a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator. It works by widening the pulmonary arteries (the blood vessels that send blood from the heart to the lungs to receive oxygen), making it easier for the heart to pump blood through the lungs. This should improve symptoms such as breathlessness and increase your ability to exercise.

title: Insulin Glargine
url_slug: Insulin-Glargine
keywords: Glargine,LANTUS,Toujeo,
```

## What is this medication for?  

Glargine is a long-acting insulin. It is used to reduce high blood sugar levels in patients with diabetes mellitus.  

## How should I take/use this medication?  

Insulin Glargine is usually given once a day with or without food as an injection into the fatty tissue that is between the skin and muscle layer. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse and as described in the manual. 

  

Ensure that your insulin appears clear and colourless before use. Do not use it if it appears cloudy, grainy or if particles are seen.  

  

  

How to select an injection site  

Insulin should be injected into the fatty tissue that is between the skin and muscle layer. You should rotate the injection site within the same area to prevent your body from forming lipodystrophy (a small lump or dent in the skin that forms when a person repeatedly injects in the same spot).

Do not inject insulin in the areas that are actively used during exercise.   

Your abdomen or stomach area is the best site for injection as it provides the fastest and most consistent absorption of insulin.  

  

  

How to inject insulin  

1\. Clean the skin before injecting the insulin

2\. Lift a skin fold.

3\. Insert the needle at 90 degrees, at a right angle to the skin.

4\. During the injection, inject the insulin by pushing the plunger all the way down slowly with your index finger

*   If you are using an insulin pen, hold the needle and pen in place for 10 seconds before removing the needle and releasing the pinched skin  
    
*   If you are using the insulin vial and syringe, there is no need to hold the needle in place for 10 seconds.   
    

5\. While removing the needle from your skin, make sure you keep the plunger pushed down. This will ensure you get the full dose. Do not rub or massage the injection site. 

6. Throw the syringe or pen needle away properly in a container that cannot be punctured.

You may refer to [this article](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/Insulin-Injection-Technique) for more details on insulin injection techniques.

  

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?  

If you missed a dose, discuss with your doctor on what to do next.  

If you forget to inject your insulin, your blood sugar may get too high, a condition known as hyperglycemia. Check your blood sugar with a home blood sugar meter (glucometer).   

  

If your blood sugar remains high for too long, you might develop diabetic ketoacidosis. This is a complication of diabetes that is caused by an increase in the amount of ketones in your blood or urine, which causes your blood to become more acidic.  Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include:  

*   Increased urination
*   Feeling thirsty
*   Feeling sick, nauseous or vomiting
*   Feeling drowsy or tired
*   Having abdominal pain
*   Having a flushed face 
*   Sweet fruity smell in your breath

You should see the doctor immediately if you have the above symptoms.  

  

## What precautions should I take?

Inform your healthcare professional if you:  

*   Are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication
*   Drink alcohol often
*   Are eating less than usual due to sickness/a changed diet as your dosage may need to be changed
*   Are travelling across different time zones. You might need to adjust the number of meals and the dose of your insulin depending on where you travel to.  
    
*   Are pregnant or breastfeeding  
    

Discuss with your doctor if you should omit this insulin injection until after your blood test is taken.  

  

## What are some common side-effects of this medication?

Like all medications, this medication may cause some possible side effects but not everyone experiences them. Consult your healthcare professional if any of the side effects becomes severe and bothersome.

  

This medication may cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Symptoms of low blood sugar include:

*   Weakness 
*   Dizziness 
*   Hunger 
*   Sweating 
*   Trembling   
    
*   Blurred vision 
*   Walking unsteadily 
*   Fast heartbeat  
    

If you experience any of these low blood sugar symptoms, do the following immediately: 

  

Step 1: Check your blood sugar with a home blood sugar meter (glucometer) if available. If your blood sugar level is less than 4 mmol/L, take 15 grams of fast-acting sugar. Examples of 15 grams of fast-acting sugar include:

*   3 glucose tablets or 
*   Half a glass of fruit juice (200ml) or 
*   Half a can of soft drink or sweetened drink (175ml) or
*   1 can of less sugar soft drink (330ml) or
*   3 teaspoons of sugar, honey or syrup 

  

Step 2: Monitor yourself for 15 minutes. If you have a glucometer (home blood sugar meter), check your blood sugar level again after 15 minutes.

  

Step 3: If your blood sugar level is still less than 4 mmol/L or you still have symptoms of low blood sugar, you should take another 15 grams of fast-acting sugar as per Step 1. 

  

If your symptoms do not go away, see a doctor or go to the hospital immediately.

  

Step 4: Take your meal or snack if your blood sugar level is 4 mmol/L and above after consuming the fast-acting sugar earlier on.

  

Low blood sugar may occur if you: 

*   Inject too much insulin
*   Do not eat on time, miss your meals or change your diet
*   Exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal
*   Do not eat well due to an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting)
*   Drink alcohol on an empty stomach while injecting insulin
*   Have kidney or liver problems which have worsened

Some patients may also experience mild pain, redness, bruising, swelling, a small lump or dent of the skin at the injection site.

*   Do not reuse your needles, rotate injection sites within the recommended areas and use shorter needles (4mm or 6mm) to reduce the chances of developing such reactions. 
*   They also usually go away in a few days to a few weeks. 
*   See a doctor if you frequently experience this. Your injection technique may need to be reviewed.

## What are some rare but serious side-effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?

See a doctor or go to the hospital immediately if your blood sugar level is always low (less than 4 mmol/L) or you continue to experience symptoms of low blood sugar even after taking some sugar (see instructions above for management of low blood sugar).  

  

## What food or medication should I avoid when I take this medication?

Avoid taking alcohol with this medication as this may increase your risk of having low blood sugar.  

  

## How should I store this medication?  

Store all unopened insulin in a refrigerator between 2 to 8 degrees Celsius. Do not freeze. 

  

Do not keep insulin in a hot place (eg. in a hot, closed vehicle, on top of a television set) or expose it to heat or sunlight. Do not use the insulin if this happens. 

  

Once the insulin has been first used, do not refrigerate, but keep it in a cool dry place. Discard the insulin 4 weeks (Lantus) and 6 weeks (Toujeo) after opening. Lantus and Toujeo are different brands of glargine. Toujeo is more concentrated than Lantus. 

  

Keep this medication out of reach of children. Throw away all expired medication.  

  

## How do I handle this medication safely?

Please refer to the product insert which can be found in the medication box, for instructions for use of your specific insulin preparation.  

  

## How should I throw away this medication safely?

You may throw this injection away along with the used needles into a metal tin or thick plastic container (eg. detergent bottles). You can also buy a container specially designed to throw sharp items, known as a sharps box, to prevent any injuries due to the needles.

url_slug: Insulin-Glulisine
keywords: Glulisine,APIDRA,Insulin,
```

## What is this medication for?

Insulin Glulisine is a rapid (fast) acting insulin. It is used to control blood sugar levels after each meal. 

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

Insulin Glulisine is given immediately or 15 minutes before a meal as an injection into the fatty tissue that is between the skin and muscle layer.

   

Do not forget to eat after injecting Insulin Glulisine. If you need to, you can inject immediately after a meal instead. 

  

Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse and as described in the manual.

  

Ensure that your insulin appears clear and colourless before use. Do not use it if it appears cloudy, grainy or if particles are seen in the penfill or vial.

  

Do not stop insulin without checking with your doctor.

  

How to select an injection site

Insulin should be injected into the fatty tissue that is between the skin and muscle layer. You should rotate the injection site within the same area to prevent your body from forming lipodystrophy (a small lump or dent in the skin that forms when a person repeatedly injects in the same spot).

   

Do not inject insulin in the areas that are actively used during exercise. 

  

Your abdomen or stomach area is the best site for injection as it provides the fastest and most consistent absorption of insulin.

  

How to inject insulin  

1.  Clean the skin before injecting the insulin. 
2.  Lift a skin fold.
3.  Insert the needle at 90 degrees, at a right angle to the skin. 
4.  During the injection, inject the insulin by pushing the plunger all the way down slowly with your index finger.

*   If you are using an insulin pen, hold the needle and pen in place for 10 seconds before removing the needle and releasing the pinched skin
*   If you are using the insulin vial and syringe, there is no need to hold the needle in place for 10 seconds 

6.  While removing the needle from your skin, make sure you keep the plunger pushed down. This will ensure you get the full dose. Do not rub or massage the injection site. 
7.  Throw the syringe or pen needle away properly in a container that cannot be punctured.

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

If you missed a dose before your meal, it can be given immediately after your meal.

   

If you forget to inject your insulin, your blood sugar may get too high, a condition known as hyperglycemia. Check your blood sugar with a home blood sugar meter (glucometer).

   

If your blood sugar remains high for too long, you might develop diabetic ketoacidosis. This is a complication of diabetes that is caused by an increase in the amount of ketones in your blood or urine, which causes your blood to become more acidic. Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include:

*   Increased urination
*   Feeling thirsty
*   Feeling sick, nauseous or vomiting
*   Feeling drowsy or tired
*   Having abdominal pain
*   Having a flushed face 
*   Sweet fruity smell in your breath

You should see the doctor immediately if you have the above symptoms. 

  

## What precautions should I take?

Inform your healthcare professional if you:

*   Are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication
*   Drink alcohol often  
    
*   Are eating less than usual due to sickness/a changed diet as your dosage may need to be changed
*   Are travelling across different time zones. You might need to adjust the number of meals and the dose of your insulin based on where you travel to.
*   Are pregnant or breastfeeding

  

If your doctor has informed you that you need to do a fasting blood test, do not inject insulin until after you have your blood taken and are ready to eat.

  

## What are some common side effects of this medication?

Like all medications, this medication may cause some possible side effects but not everyone experiences them. Consult your healthcare professional if any of the side effects becomes severe and bothersome.

  

This medication may cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Symptoms of low blood sugar include:

*   Weakness   
    
*   Dizziness 
*   Hunger 
*   Sweating 
*   Trembling 
*   Blurred vision 
*   Walking unsteadily 
*   Fast heartbeat   
    

  

If you experience any of these low blood sugar symptoms, do the following immediately: 

Step 1: Check your blood sugar level with a home blood sugar meter (glucometer) if available. If your blood sugar level is less than 4 mmol/L, take 15 grams of fast-acting sugar.  Examples of 15 grams of fast-acting sugar include:

*   3 glucose tablets or 
*   Half a glass of fruit juice (200ml) or
*   Half a can of soft drink or sweetened drink (175ml) or
*   1 can of less sugar soft drink (330ml) or
*   3 teaspoons of sugar, honey or syrup  
    

  

Step 2: Monitor yourself for 15 minutes. If you have a glucometer (home blood sugar meter), check your blood sugar level again after 15 minutes. 

  

Step 3: If your blood sugar level is still less than 4 mmol/L or you still have symptoms of low blood sugar, you should take another 15 grams of fast-acting sugar as per Step 1.

  

If your symptoms do not go away, see a doctor or go to the hospital immediately.

  

Step 4: Take your meal or snack if your blood sugar level is 4 mmol/L and above after consuming the fast-acting sugar earlier on. 

  

Low blood sugar may occur if you: 

*   Inject too much insulin
*   Do not eat on time, miss your meals or change your diet
*   Exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal
*   Do not eat well due to an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting)
*   Drink alcohol on an empty stomach while injecting insulin
*   Have kidney or liver problems which have worsened 

  

Some patients may also experience mild pain, redness, bruising, swelling, a small lump or dent of the skin at the injection site.

*   Do not reuse your needles, rotate injection sites within the recommended areas and use shorter needles (4mm or 6mm) to reduce the chances of developing such reactions. 
*   They also usually go away in a few days to a few weeks. 
*   See a doctor if you frequently experience this. Your injection technique may need to be reviewed. 

  

## What are some rare but serious side effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?

See a doctor or go to the hospital immediately if your blood sugar level is always low (less than 4 mmol/L) or you continue to experience symptoms of low blood sugar even after taking some sugar (see instructions above for management of low blood sugar).

  

## What food or medication should I avoid when I take/use this medication?

Avoid taking alcohol with this medication as this may increase your risk of having low blood sugar.   

  

## How should I store this medication?

Store all unopened insulin in a refrigerator between 2 to 8 degrees Celsius. **Do not freeze.** 

Do not keep insulin in a hot place (eg. in a hot, closed vehicle, on top of a television set) or expose it to heat or sunlight. Do not use the insulin if this happens.   

  

Once the insulin has been first used, do not refrigerate, but keep it in a cool dry place. Discard the insulin 4 weeks after opening.   

  

Keep this medication out of reach of children. Throw away all expired medication.

keywords: 
```

## ​What is this medication for?

Pilocarpine is used to treat glaucoma. Glaucoma is a condition where pressure in the eye is increased. Untreated glaucoma can affect your eyesight and cause blindness. Pilocarpine helps to reduce the pressure in your eye.

  

## How should I use this medication?

*   Do not stop using your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.
*   For proper use of eye drop:

*   Wash your hands with soap and water, and read the instructions on the label
*   Shake the bottle
*   Tilt your head backwards and look up
*   Gently pull the lower eyelid down to form a pocket and squeeze the bottle to apply one drop into your eye. To prevent the tip of the bottle from getting dirty, make sure the tip does not touch the eye or any other surface
*   Close your eyes and press down gently on the inner corner of your eye for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the medicine to be absorbed and prevent it from being drained into the back of your throat
*   If you need to use more than 1 drop of medicine, or if you are using another type of eye drop, wait at least 5 to 10 minutes before applying the next eye drop. This is to prevent the first drop of medicine from being washed away by the second drop of medicine before it has time to work. This also prevents any medicine interactions between different eye drops
*   If your doctor prescribed both eye drops and eye ointments, you should use the eye drops first

*   For contact lens wearers:

*   Remove your contact lens before each application of medication
*   If you are using hard lens, you can put them on directly after applying the eye drops
*   If you are using soft lens, you can put them on 30 minutes after applying the eye drops. Otherwise, your lens may be damaged by the preservatives present in the eye drops
*   If you need to apply eye drops twice a day, it is recommended that you apply them once in the morning before you put on your lens, and at the end of the day after you remove your lens

title: Insulin Detemir
url_slug: Insulin-Detemir
keywords: Detemir,Levemir,Insulin,
```

## What is this medication for?  

Detemir is a long-acting insulin. It is used to reduce high blood sugar levels in patients with diabetes mellitus.

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

Insulin Detemir is given once or twice a day with or without food as an injection into the fatty tissue that is between the skin and muscle layer. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse and as described in the manual.   

  

Ensure that your insulin appears clear and colourless before use. Do not use it if it appears cloudy, grainy or if particles are seen.  

  

How to select an injection site

Insulin should be injected into the fatty tissue that is between the skin and muscle layer. You should rotate the injection site within the same area to prevent your body from forming lipodystrophy (a small lump or dent in the skin that forms when a person repeatedly injects in the same spot).   

  

Do not inject insulin in the areas that are actively used during exercise.   

  

Your abdomen or stomach area is the best site for injection as it provides the fastest and most consistent absorption of insulin. 

  

How to inject insulin  

1.  Clean the skin before injecting the insulin. 
2.  Lift a skin fold.
3.  Insert the needle at 90 degrees, at a right angle to the skin. 
4.  During the injection, inject the insulin by pushing the plunger all the way down slowly with your index finger, wait for about 10 seconds before removing the needle and releasing the pinched skin. 
5.  While removing the needle from your skin, make sure you keep the plunger pushed down.  This will ensure you get the full dose. Do not rub or massage the injection site.   
    
6.  Throw the pen needle away properly in a container that cannot be punctured.

  

You may refer to [this article](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/Insulin-Injection-Technique) for more details on insulin injection techniques.  

  

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

If you missed a dose, discuss with your doctor on what to do next.   

  

If you forget to inject your insulin, your blood sugar may get too high, a condition known as hyperglycemia. Check your blood sugar with a home blood sugar meter (glucometer).

If your blood sugar remains high for too long, you might develop diabetic ketoacidosis. This is a complication of diabetes that is caused by an increase in the amount of ketones in your blood or urine, which causes your blood to become more acidic. Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include:

*   Increased urination
*   Feeling thirsty
*   Feeling sick, nauseous or vomiting
*   Feeling drowsy or tired
*   Having abdominal pain
*   Having a flushed face 
*   Sweet fruity smell in your breath

You should see the doctor immediately if you have the above symptoms.

## ​What is this medication for?

Timolol is used to treat glaucoma. Glaucoma is a condition where pressure in the eye is increased. Untreated glaucoma can affect your eyesight and cause blindness. Timolol helps to reduce the pressure in your eye.

## How should I use this medication?

*   Do not stop using your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.
*   For proper use of eye drop:
    *   Wash your hands with soap and water, and read the instructions on the label
    *   Shake the bottle
    *   Tilt your head backwards and look up
    *   Gently pull the lower eyelid down to form a pocket and squeeze the bottle to apply one drop into your eye. To prevent the tip of the bottle from getting dirty, make sure the tip does not touch the eye or any other surface
    *   Close your eyes and press down gently on the inner corner of your eye for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the medicine to be absorbed and prevent it from being drained into the back of your throat
    *   If you need to use more than 1 drop of medicine, or if you are using another type of eye drop, wait at least 5 to 10 minutes before applying the next eye drop. This is to prevent the first drop of medicine from being washed away by the second drop of medicine before it has time to work. This also prevents any medicine interactions between different eye drops
    *   If your doctor prescribed both eye drops and eye ointments, you should use the eye drops first
*   For contact lens wearers:
    *   Remove your contact lens before each application of medication
    *   If you are using hard lens, you can put them on directly after applying the eye drops
    *   If you are using soft lens, you can put them on 30 minutes after applying the eye drops. Otherwise, your lens may be damaged by the preservatives present in the eye drops
    *   If you need to apply eye drops twice a day, it is recommended that you apply them once in the morning before you put on your lens, and at the end of the day after you remove your lens

```

## ​What Is the Pneumococcal Vaccine Used For?

Pneumococcal vaccines help to prevent pneumococcal disease caused by the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae. 

  

Pneumococcal disease includes infection of the lungs (pneumonia), ear (otitis media), brain (meningitis), blood (bacteremia) and other serious infections.  

  

Symptoms of pneumococcal disease vary depending on the infected organ. It can range from low-grade fever, cough, earache and chest pain, to more serious symptoms such as confusion or severe headaches.  

  

## What Are the Types of Pneumococcal Vaccines Available?

There are 2 types of vaccines available:

1.  Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV13)
2.  Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine (PPSV23)

PCV13 vaccine protects against 13 pneumococcal bacteria strains that most commonly cause pneumococcal disease, while the PPSV23 protects against 23 strains. PCV13 when given before PPSV23, provides extended protection in a selected group of patients, as compared to giving PPSV23 alone.  

  

## Who Should Receive the Pneumococcal Vaccine?

All infants should be given two doses of PCV13 (at ages 4 and 6 months), with a booster at 12 months. Children who fall behind should be given catch-up vaccination through to 59 months of age. You may refer to the Singapore National Childhood Immunisation Schedule or ask your child’s doctor for more details.  

  

In the elderly aged 65 years and above, one dose each of PCV13 and PPSV23 is recommended to provide lifetime protection.  

  

Please consult your doctor for more details (e.g. on the number of recommended doses and types of vaccine) for the following medical conditions:

*   Persons aged 18 years and older with chronic illnesses, such as chronic lung, heart, kidney or liver diseases and diabetes mellitus
*   Persons who are immunocompromised (having lower body resistance to infections) or with other medical conditions, such as persons with:

*   Cochlear implants or cerebrospinal fluid leaks; 
*   Abnormal spleen function (including conditions such as homozygous sickle cell disease and coeliac syndrome)

**Click** [**here**](https://book.health.gov.sg/) **to book a pneumococcal vaccination appointment.**

*   You have a history of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (a rare nerve condition)
*   You are pregnant or breastfeeding  
    

## How Is the Pneumococcal Vaccine Given?

It is given by injection into a muscle.  

  

For individuals in which both PCV13 and PPSV23 are recommended, and who have yet to receive any pneumococcal vaccine, PCV13 should be given first, followed by PPSV23 a year later (or at least after a minimum interval of 8 weeks) for better protection.  

  

## What Are Some Common Side-Effects of the Pneumococcal Vaccine?

*   Some people may feel faint after the vaccination

url_slug: Oral-Corticosteroid
keywords: Corticosteroid,Steroid,Adrenal insufficiency,Severe allergy,Asthma,Arthritis,
```

## ​What is this medication for?  

The adrenal glands which lie just above the kidney produce steroid hormones. Corticosteroids are medications which act in the same way as steroid hormones. Certain corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone are used to replace the body’s production when the adrenal glands are not working normally.   

  

Corticosteroids such as prednisolone can also be used to reduce inflammation (signs include warmth, redness, swelling and pain) or calm an overactive immune system. Therefore, steroids can help to reduce swelling, redness, itchiness and allergic reactions. They are used in different conditions such as severe allergies, skin problems, asthma, arthritis (joint inflammation) and autoimmune diseases (where the immune system attacks the body).

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   Your doctor will tell you how much and how often to take the medication. Your doctor will prescribe the lowest effective dose for you.

*   Take corticosteroids with or after food to prevent stomach upset.

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?  

If you forget a dose, take it as soon as you remember and then continue to take it as you normally would. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the usual time. Do not double or increase the dose to make up for the missed dose.

Swallow the tablet whole with a glass of water immediately before a meal or chew the tablet with the first mouthful of food. 

##

## How should I take/use this medication?  

*   Proper use of eye drop

*   Wash your hands with soap and water, and read the instructions on the label.
*   Shake the bottle.
*   Tilt your head backwards and look up.
*   Gently pull the lower eyelid down to form a pocket and squeeze the bottle to apply one drop into your eye. To prevent the tip of the bottle from getting dirty, make sure the tip does not touch the eye or any other surface.
*   Close your eyes gently and wipe off any excess eye drops around your eyes with a clean tissue.
*   Keep your eyes closed and press down gently on the inner corner of your eye for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the medication to be absorbed.
*   If you need to use more than 1 drop of medication, or if you are using another type of eye drop, wait at least 5 to 10 minutes before applying the next eye drop. This is to prevent the first drop of medication from being washed away by the second drop before it has time to work. This also prevents any medication interactions between different eye drops.
*   If your doctor prescribed both eye drops and eye ointments, you should use the eye drops first.

title: Nicotine Replacement Therapy – Gum (Nicorette®, Nicotinell®)
url_slug: Nicotine-Replacement-Therapy-Gum-Nicorette-Nicotinell
keywords: Nicorette,Nicotinell,Nicotine Gum,Nicotine Replacement Therapy,
```

## What is this medication for?

Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) delivers nicotine without the other harmful chemicals present in cigarette smoke. It reduces the withdrawal symptoms experienced when you are trying to quit smoking, allowing you to focus on the other aspects in your effort to quit smoking.  

  

Nicotine gum releases a dose of nicotine when chewed to reduce the urge to smoke.  

  

## How should I use this medication?

When you feel the urge to smoke, chew one gum to release a taste or until you feel a tingling sensation then park the gum between your cheek and gum. Continue chewing the gum when the taste has faded. Repeat for about 30 minutes until the gum has no more taste, then spit it out. You can chew on one gum every 1-2 hours.

  

Do not swallow the gum.

  

Do not use more than the recommended maximum number of gums as instructed by your healthcare professional or use more than one gum each time. 

  

## What precautions should I take?

You should stop smoking once you start to use NRT. Smoking and using NRT at the same time may increase the risk of adverse effects from the additive effects of nicotine in your body.   

  

If you continue to feel the urge to smoke or experience severe nicotine withdrawal symptoms even after using the NRT gums, please inform your healthcare professional as you may need other types of NRT.

  

Inform your healthcare professional if: 

*   You are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding.
*   You recently had a heart attack or stroke.
*   You have active peptic ulcer disease.
*   You are using dentures.
*   You have any other medical conditions. 
*   You are taking any other medications, including supplements, traditional medications and herbal remedies.
*   You are less than 18 years old.

## What are some common side-effects of this medication?

*   Throat irritation
*   Jaw ache
*   Increased salivation
*   Hiccups
*   Dry mouth
*   Flatulence
*   Stomach discomfort
*   Heartburn
*   Nausea and vomiting
*   Dizziness
*   Headache

These side effects usually occur as a result of intense chewing of gum. Make sure to park the gum between your cheek and gum once the taste appears and take longer breaks in between gums to reduce these side effects.  

  

## What are some rare but serious side-effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?

The symptoms of a drug allergy include one or more of the following: 

*   Swollen face/eyes/lips/tongue
*   Difficulty in breathing
*   Itchy skin rashes over your whole body

If you experience any of these symptoms, you should stop your medication and see your healthcare professional immediately.  

  

## What food or medication should I avoid when I take this medication?

*   Avoid coffee, tea, juices, acidic and fizzy drinks 15 minutes before and during use of nicotine gum as this may reduce nicotine absorption.
*   Nicotine may reduce the effect of certain medications. When NRT dose is reduced or stopped, adjustments to these medications may be necessary.
*   These medications include:

*   Benzodiazepines (e.g. diazepam, lorazepam)
*   Insulin
*   Beta-blocker (e.g. bisoprolol, atenolol)
*   Opioid painkillers (e.g. codeine)

*   Inform your doctor or pharmacist about other medications – including over-the-counter medications, supplements and traditional/herbal remedies – that you are currently taking as they may affect the way you benefit from NRT.

## How should I store this medication?

Store in a cool and dry place, away from direct sunlight. Keep this medication away from children. 

  

## How should I throw away this medication safely?

Discard the gum properly into the empty blister packaging or into a tissue paper before disposing into a black trash bag. Seal it tightly before throwing into the rubbish chute or bin.

title: Premixed/Biphasic Insulin
url_slug: Premixed-Biphasic-Insulin
keywords: Novomix,MIXTARD,
```

## What is this medication for?  

Novomix/Mixtard is a premixed insulin. It is a mix of intermediate-acting and short-acting insulins. It is used to reduce high blood sugar levels in patient with diabetes mellitus. The short-acting insulin helps to bring down the high sugar level after a meal, while the intermediate-acting insulin helps to control your blood sugar levels throughout the day. 

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

Use Novomix/Mixtard as instructed by your doctor. 

  

The medication should be injected into the fatty tissue that is between the skin and muscle layer. 

*   Inject Novomix immediately before meals 
*   Inject Mixtard 30 minutes before meals 

Your medication should look like milk or look cloudy. Roll the flexpen or penfill in your palms to resuspend the insulin before using. If you see any white substance that remains at the bottom of the container after resuspending it, you should not use it.  

  

For Novomix flexpen and Mixtard penfill, always check that there are at least 12 units of insulin left in the pen or penfill to allow resuspension. If there are less than 12 units left, please use a new insulin pen or penfill.   

  

  

How to select an injection site  

Insulin should be injected into the fatty tissue that is between the skin and muscle layer. You should rotate the injection site within the same area to prevent your body from forming lipodystrophy (a small lump or dent in the skin that forms when a person repeatedly injects in the same spot).

Do not inject insulin in the areas that are actively used during exercise.   

Your abdomen or stomach area is the best site for injection as it provides the fastest and most consistent absorption of insulin.  

  

  

How to inject insulin  

1\. Clean the skin before injecting the insulin

2\. Lift a skin fold.

3\. Insert the needle at 90 degrees, at a right angle to the skin.

4\. During the injection, inject the insulin by pushing the plunger all the way down slowly with your index finger

*   If you are using an insulin pen, hold the needle and pen in place for 10 seconds before removing the needle and releasing the pinched skin  
    
*   If you are using the insulin vial and syringe, there is no need to hold the needle in place for 10 seconds.   
    

5\. While removing the needle from your skin, make sure you keep the plunger pushed down. This will ensure you get the full dose. Do not rub or massage the injection site. 

6. Throw the syringe or pen needle away properly in a container that cannot be punctured.

You may refer to [this article](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/Insulin-Injection-Technique) for more details on insulin injection techniques.

  

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

If you missed a dose before your meal, it can be given immediately after your meal.  

  

If you forget to inject your insulin, your blood sugar may get too high, a condition known as hyperglycemia. Check your blood sugar with a home blood sugar meter (glucometer). 

  

If your blood sugar remains high for too long, you might develop diabetic ketoacidosis. This is a complication of diabetes that is caused by an increase in the amount of ketones in your blood or urine, which causes your blood to become more acidic.  Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include:

*   Increased urination
*   Feeling thirsty
*   Feeling sick, nauseous or vomiting
*   Feeling drowsy or tired
*   Having abdominal pain
*   Having a flushed face 
*   Sweet fruity smell in your breath

You should see the doctor immediately if you have the above symptoms.  

  

## What precautions should I take?

Inform your healthcare professional if you:  

*   Are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication
*   Drink alcohol often
*   Are eating less than usual due to sickness/a changed diet as your dosage may need to be changed
*   Are travelling across different time zones. You might need to adjust the number of meals and the dose of your insulin depending on where you travel to.  
    
*   Are pregnant or breastfeeding

If your doctor has informed you that you need to do a fasting blood test, do not inject insulin until after you have your blood taken and are ready to eat.   

  

## What are some common side-effects of this medication?

Like all medications, this medication may cause some possible side effects but not everyone experiences them. Consult your healthcare professional if any of the side effects becomes severe and bothersome.

  

This medication may cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Symptoms of low blood sugar include:

*   Weakness 
*   Dizziness 
*   Hunger 
*   Sweating 
*   Trembling   
    
*   Blurred vision 
*   Walking unsteadily 
*   Fast heartbeat  
    

If you experience any of these low blood sugar symptoms, do the following immediately: 

  

Step 1: Check your blood sugar with a home blood sugar meter (glucometer) if available. If your blood sugar level is less than 4 mmol/L, take 15 grams of fast-acting sugar. Examples of 15 grams of fast-acting sugar include:

*   3 glucose tablets or 
*   Half a glass of fruit juice (200ml) or 
*   Half a can of soft drink or sweetened drink (175ml) or
*   1 can of less sugar soft drink (330ml) or
*   3 teaspoons of sugar, honey or syrup 

Step 2: Monitor yourself for 15 minutes. If you have a glucometer (home blood sugar meter), check your blood sugar level again after 15 minutes.

  

Step 3: If your blood sugar level is still less than 4 mmol/L or you still have symptoms of low blood sugar, you should take another 15 grams of fast-acting sugar as per Step 1. 

  

If your symptoms do not go away, see a doctor or go to the hospital immediately.

  

Step 4: Take your meal or snack if your blood sugar level is 4 mmol/L and above after consuming the fast-acting sugar earlier on.

  

Low blood sugar may occur if you: 

*   Inject too much insulin
*   Do not eat on time, miss your meals or change your diet
*   Exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal
*   Do not eat well due to an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting)
*   Drink alcohol on an empty stomach while injecting insulin
*   Have kidney or liver problems which have worsened

Some patients may also experience mild pain, redness, bruising, swelling, a small lump or dent of the skin at the injection site.

*   Do not reuse your needles, rotate injection sites within the recommended areas and use shorter needles (4mm or 6mm) to reduce the chances of developing such reactions. 
*   They also usually go away in a few days to a few weeks. 
*   See a doctor if you frequently experience this. Your injection technique may need to be reviewed.

## What are some rare but serious side-effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?

See a doctor or go to the hospital immediately if your blood sugar level is always low (less than 4 mmol/L) or you continue to experience symptoms of low blood sugar even after taking some sugar (see instructions above for management of low blood sugar).  

  

## What food or medication should I avoid when I take this medication?

Avoid taking alcohol with this medication as this may increase your risk of having low blood sugar.

url_slug: Atorvastatin
keywords: atorvastatin,Lipitor,
```

## ​What is this medication for?

Atorvastatin belongs to the class of medications called Statins (also known as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors). Statins lower the amount of ‘bad cholesterol’ (low density lipoprotein or LDL-cholesterol) and ‘fat’ (triglyceride) in the blood as well as increase the amount of ‘good cholesterol’ (high density lipoprotein or HDL-cholesterol). 

  

High ‘bad cholesterol’ levels can cause your blood vessels to clog up and lead to chest pain (angina), heart attack or stroke. Hence, statins may reduce your risk for heart attack and stroke. 

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional. If you stop taking your medication, your ‘bad cholesterol’ level may rise again.  
    
*   You may take this medication with or without food. 

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

If you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, take only the usual dose. Do not double your dose or use extra medication to make up for the missed dose.  

  

## What precautions should I take?

Inform your healthcare professional if: 

*   You are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication

Important Notes:

1\. The “Symptoms to Treat” list above is not exhaustive. Consult your pharmacist or doctor if you have any other questions.

2\. Some products contain a combination of the above medications to treat a few symptoms at the same time e.g. Zyrtec-D helps with both runny and blocked nose; Panadol Cough and Cold may treat fever, headaches, body aches, phlegm and blocked nose; Robitussin DM for cough and phlegm. To avoid taking double the dose of the same medication or taking medication that you do not need, please check the ingredients of all products and speak to a pharmacist to be sure.

3\. Some of the “Possible Products” listed above will need to be dispensed by a pharmacist. Approach the pharmacist if you cannot find the products that you are looking for.

For **chronic medications** (e.g. those for the treatment of diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, blood-thinning etc.), you will need to ensure you have enough to last the duration of your trip. You may consider packing twice the amount of chronic medications you need for the trip duration and pack each set in a different bag or luggage. This is in case your luggage is lost or your trip is extended. You may want to ask your doctor or pharmacist to assist you in providing a medication list for you to follow, and check them off as you pack the necessary.

For **medications to protect against certain conditions or diseases**, consult a pharmacist (e.g. for anti-malarial medications) or doctor (e.g. for anti-malarial medications, high altitude sickness medications for trekking).

## How much medication should I bring?

The quantity of medications to bring should be calculated based on the following:

*   How many times a day they should be taken 
*   How many days they should be used to treat the medical condition
*   How long you are travelling for
*   The number of people in your travel group who require them

For medications to treat minor ailments, you can round the quantity up or down according to your preference. Below are some examples to guide you.

1\. Symptoms of cold/flu/influenza may last for more than 2 weeks.

(a) Runny Nose

You choose to bring Cetirizine tablets. Generally, for adults, 1 tablet is to be taken once a day. Total = 1 tablet x 14 days = 14 tablets (can be rounded up to 20 tablets – to purchase 1-2 boxes if each box has 10 tablets)

(b) Fever/Headache

You choose to bring Paracetamol tablets. Generally, for adults, 2 tablets are to be taken up to 4 times a day. Total = 2 tablets x 4 x 14 days = 112 tablets

2\. When visiting countries where there may be a concern for stomach upset or diarrhoea (e.g. spicy food, unclean food), preparing an appropriate amount of medications may be enough.

(a) You will be staying in Thailand for 2 days

You choose to bring Loperamide capsules. Maximum of 8 capsules can be taken in a day. Total = 8 capsules x 2 days = 16 capsules

3\. Chronic medications should also be calculated accordingly.

(a) You take 1 tablet of Amlodipine 5 mg once a day for high blood pressure. For a 5-day trip, you will need 1 tablet x 5 days = 5 tablets.

(b) You take 1 tablet of Metformin XR 500mg twice daily for diabetes. For a 8-day trip, you will need 2 tablets a day x 8 days = 16 tablets.

Ask your pharmacist or doctor for advice if you have doubts!

## Where do I get my medications from?

Most of the medications used to manage minor ailments may be easily obtained over the counter or dispensed by a pharmacist.

Chronic medications must be obtained from a doctor at clinics/polyclinics/hospitals or from a pharmacist with a doctor’s prescription. Visit your doctor at least a few weeks before your departure to ensure that you have enough medication. You may also ask your doctor to prepare a copy of your medical history with a list of medications which you are taking for you to bring overseas.

## How do I pack my medications for travel?

*   Pack your medications apart from your toiletries.
*   Carry all medications and supplies in their original containers or packaging.
*   Medications which are formulated as tablets or lozenges can be either hand-carried or checked-in.
*   If you would like to carry liquid medications into the aircraft, each bottle should only have a maximum volume of 100ml, and they should be placed inside a ziplock bag, whose volume in total cannot exceed 1L. If the medication bottles are larger than 100ml, you must pack them into a check-in luggage.
*   All inhalers may be hand-carried onto the aircraft.
*   Insulin preparations and devices used to inject the insulin (e.g. needles) should be hand-carried onto the aircraft. Upon arriving at airport security, you should declare to the officers that you have these items and allow these items to be passed through the necessary scans.
*   Bring a copy of your prescription or medication list to answer any questions from airport security regarding the contents of your medication.

## How do I store my medications during travel?

Medications in general should be stored in a cool and dry place. Both the aircraft cabin and the luggage hold of the aircraft meet the criteria.

For insulin preparations, you may choose to store them inside a cooler bag to carry onto the aircraft. Most insulin preparations are usually stable at room temperature for around 4 weeks upon first opening, before being discarded. You may ask your pharmacist or doctor or refer to the product’s information leaflet for details.

title: Insulin Lispro Protamine & Insulin Lispro Suspension
url_slug: Insulin-Lispro-Protamine-Insulin-Lispro-Suspension
keywords: Insulin Lispro Protamine ＆ Insulin Lispro Suspension,Humalog Mix 50/50,
```

## What is this medication for?

Humalog Mix is a premixed insulin. It is a mix of intermediate-acting and short-acting insulins. It is used to reduce high blood sugar levels in patients with diabetes mellitus. The short-acting insulin helps to control blood sugar levels after each meal, while the intermediate-acting insulin helps to control your blood sugar levels throughout the day. 

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

Humalog Mix is given 15 minutes before meals as an injection into the fatty tissue that is between the skin and muscle layer. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse and as described in the manual.   

  

Ensure insulin appears uniformly cloudy or milky before using by gently rolling the pen in your hands 10 times. Then turn the KwikPen up and down so that the glass ball moves from one end of the pen to the other at least 10 times.   

  

Do not use it if there is any change to the color of the insulin, or if any particles or sediments are seen.

  

  

How to select an injection site

Insulin should be injected into the fatty tissue that is between the skin and muscle layer. You should rotate the injection site within the same area to prevent your body from forming lipodystrophy (a small lump or dent in the skin that forms when a person repeatedly injects in the same spot).   

  

Do not inject insulin in the areas that are actively used during exercise.

   

Your abdomen or stomach area is the best site for injection as it provides the fastest and most consistent absorption of insulin. 

  

  

How to inject insulin

1.  Clean the skin before injecting the insulin. 
2.  Lift a skin fold.
3.  Insert the needle at 90 degrees, at a right angle to the skin. 
4.  During the injection, inject the insulin by pushing the plunger all the way down slowly with your index finger.
5.  Hold the needle and pen in place for 10 seconds before removing the needle and releasing the pinched skin.
6.  While removing the needle from your skin, make sure you keep the plunger pushed down. This will ensure you get the full dose. Do not rub or massage the injection site. 
7.  Throw the pen needle away properly in a container that cannot be punctured.

  

You may refer to [this article](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/Insulin-Injection-Technique) for more details on insulin injection techniques.  
   

  

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

If you missed a dose before your meal, it can be given immediately after your meal. 

  

If you forget to inject your insulin, your blood sugar may get too high, a condition known as hyperglycemia. Check your blood sugar with a home blood sugar meter (glucometer).

   

If your blood sugar remains high for too long, you might develop diabetic ketoacidosis. This is a complication of diabetes that is caused by an increase in the amount of ketones in your blood or urine, which causes your blood to become more acidic. Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include:

*   Increased urination
*   Feeling thirsty
*   Feeling sick, nauseous or vomiting
*   Feeling drowsy or tired
*   Having abdominal pain
*   Having a flushed face 
*   Sweet fruity smell in your breath

You should see the doctor immediately if you have the above symptoms.

  

## What precautions should I take?

Inform your healthcare professional if you:

*   Are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication
*   Drink alcohol often
*   Are eating less than usual due to sickness/a changed diet as your dosage may need to be changed
*   Are travelling across different time zones. You might need to adjust the number of meals and the dose of your insulin based on where you travel to. 
*   Are pregnant or breastfeeding

  

If your doctor has informed you that you need to do a fasting blood test, do not inject insulin until after you have your blood taken and are ready to eat.

  

## What are some common side effects of this medication?

Like all medications, this medication may cause some possible side effects but not everyone experiences them. Consult your healthcare professional if any of the side effects becomes severe and bothersome.

  

This medication may cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Symptoms of low blood sugar include:

*   Weakness 
*   Dizziness 
*   Hunger 
*   Sweating 
*   Trembling 
*   Blurred vision 
*   Walking unsteadily 
*   Fast heartbeat 

If you experience any of these low blood sugar symptoms, do the following immediately: 

Step 1: Check your blood sugar level with a home blood sugar meter (glucometer) if available. If your blood sugar level is less than 4 mmol/L, take 15 grams of fast-acting sugar. Examples of 15 grams of fast-acting sugar include:

*   3 glucose tablets or   
    
*   Half a glass of fruit juice (200ml) or  
    
*   Half a can of soft drink or sweetened drink (175ml) or  
    
*   1 can of less sugar soft drink (330ml) or  
    
*   3 teaspoons of sugar, honey or syrup  
    

  

Step 2: Monitor yourself for 15 minutes. If you have a glucometer (home blood sugar meter), check your blood sugar level again after 15 minutes. 

  

Step 3: If your blood sugar level is still less than 4 mmol/L or you still have symptoms of low blood sugar, you should take another 15 grams of fast-acting sugar as per Step 1.

  

If your symptoms do not go away, see a doctor or go to the hospital immediately.

  

Step 4: Take your meal or snack if your blood sugar level is 4 mmol/L and above after consuming the fast-acting sugar earlier on. 

  

Low blood sugar may occur if you: 

*   Inject too much insulin
*   Do not eat on time, miss your meals or change your diet
*   Exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal
*   Do not eat well due to an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting)
*   Drink alcohol on an empty stomach while injecting insulin
*   Have kidney or liver problems which have worsened 

  

Some patients may also experience mild pain, redness, bruising, swelling, a small lump or dent of the skin at the injection site.

*   Do not reuse your needles, rotate injection sites within the recommended areas and use shorter needles (4mm or 6mm) to reduce the chances of developing such reactions. 
*   They also usually go away in a few days to a few weeks. 
*   See a doctor if you frequently experience this. Your injection technique may need to be reviewed.  

  

## What are some rare but serious side effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?

See a doctor or go to the hospital immediately if your blood sugar level is always low (less than 4 mmol/L) or you continue to experience symptoms of low blood sugar even after taking some sugar (see instructions above for management of low blood sugar).

  

## What food or medication should I avoid when I take/use this medication?

Avoid taking alcohol with this medication as this may increase your risk of having low blood sugar.  

  

## How should I store this medication?

Store all unopened insulin in a refrigerator between 2 to 8 degrees Celsius.  **Do not freeze**.   

  

Do not keep insulin in a hot place (eg. in a hot, closed vehicle, on top of a television set)  or expose it to heat or sunlight.   

  

Once the insulin has been first used, do not refrigerate, but keep it in a cool dry place. Discard the insulin 4 weeks after opening. 

  

Keep this medication out of reach of children. Throw away all expired medication.

  

## How do I handle this medication safely?

## What is worm infestation?

Worm infestations happen when worms infect the intestines and other parts of the body. Examples of the different worms are pinworms, roundworms, whipworms, hookworms, tapeworms and flukes.

A patient with a mild infestation might not show any symptoms. However, some may experience itching around the anal area. The itch normally happens at night when the female worm lays eggs at areas surrounding the anus.

## What are the possible causes of this condition?

A worm infestation spreads most commonly through passing of the worm eggs from the anus to the mouth. Worm eggs are often found under the fingernails of the infected person who has scratched the area around the anus. When the infected person uses their contaminated fingers to handle food or eat, the worm eggs are transferred indirectly from the anus to the mouth.

Worm eggs that fall off the areas surrounding the anus into the environment can also be breathed in. Worm eggs may also be spread by house dust, from pets or through contact with contaminated objects such as bedding, cups, utensils or doorknobs.

## What are the symptoms of worm infestation?

The symptoms of this condition can include the following:

*   Itching around the anal area, especially at night
    
*   Poor appetite causing weight loss
    
*   Stomach discomfort, diarrhoea, nausea
    
*   Poor sleep
    
*   Being unable to concentrate
    
*   Spotting worms in your stool during bowel movement
    

## What can I do to treat worm infestation?

Worm infestation can be treated in the following ways and you can approach your pharmacist to get the following medication.

*   Albendazole
    

## When do I need to see a doctor?

Although worm infestation can be treated without a doctor’s consultation, there are times where the condition might be more serious. You should see a doctor if you experience any of the following:

*   Have blood or pus in your stool
    
*   Are vomiting daily or frequently
    
*   Fever
    
*   Extremely tired and dehydrated
    
*   Losing weight with no obvious reason
    
*   Feel sick, have diarrhea or stomach pain for more than 2 weeks.
    
*   Have a red and itching rash on your skin shaped like a worm
    

## What else can I do to manage this condition?

Other than using medications to treat the condition, worm infestations can also be managed by the following methods:

*   Wash the clothes and bedding with hot water for the whole family. Do not shake these items before you wash them as shaking the clothes or bedding can spread eggs into the air.
    
*   Clean the floor by vacuuming or mopping for a few days after being treated for the worm infestation.
    
*   Treat family members who are in close contact with the infected person.
    

The following are some suggestions to prevent worm infestations from happening again:

*   Keep your fingernails short to prevent the transfer of eggs to the fingernails and avoid biting your nails. Cut and scrub the nails of infected persons with a brush and soap.
    
*   Practice good hygiene such as washing your hands with soap before cooking, eating, after playing, changing diapers, using the toilet and touching an animal or animal waste.
    
*   Make sure your food is cooked properly. You should only drink safe and clean water.
    
*   Have daily morning showers to remove any eggs that were laid at the area around the anus.
    
*   Avoid walking barefoot.

url_slug: Ellipta-Inhaler
keywords: Ellipta,
```

## ​What is Ellipta?  

*   Ellipta is an inhaler device that helps deliver a specific amount of medication to your lungs.
*   It is used to deliver medications that are used for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
*   Both asthma and COPD affect the lungs which makes it harder for the person to breathe.   
    

## Why is it important to use an Ellipta correctly?

*   Ellipta delivers a very small dose of the medication each time, thus you usually do not feel or taste anything after a dose.
*   Hence, it is important to use the Ellipta correctly to get the full dosage and benefit from the medication.
*   This allows the medication to have a higher chance of reaching the small airways, which increases the effectiveness of the medication and helps reduce any side effects.  
    

## How does an Ellipta work?

Each Ellipta consists of a plastic device with blister strips containing a dry powdered medication. It is activated by breath. This means that when you inhale, the Ellipta automatically releases the medication.

## How should I use an Ellipta?  

  

**​Steps**  

**​Description**  

​1  

​Hold the inhaler in one hand and slide down the cover with the other hand until you hear a click sound. You will also see that the number on the dose counter will reduce by one.  

​2  

​Breathe out normally away from the Ellipta. Do not breathe into the Ellipta.  

​3  

​Put the mouthpiece in your mouth and seal your lips around the mouthpiece. Do not block the air vent with your fingers or lips.  

​4  

​Breathe in as steadily and deeply as you can until your lungs are full.  

​5  

​Hold your breath for at least 5 seconds or for as long as you can.  

​6  

​Remove the Ellipta from your mouth.  

​7  

​Breathe out slowly and gently with your mouth.  

​8  

​Clean the mouthpiece with a dry tissue before closing the cover.  

​9  

If your Ellipta contains a steroid, please rinse your mouth with water after use to prevent oral fungal infection.   

##   

## What should I avoid when using an Ellipta?

*   Do not open and close the cover without inhaling the medication as you will lose the dose.
*   Do not blow into the Ellipta or immerse it into water.
*   Do not shake the inhaler.  
    

## How should I store an Ellipta inhaler?

Store in a cool and dry place, away from direct sunlight. Keep this medication away from children. 

  

## How should I clean my Ellipta inhaler?

Wipe the outside of the mouthpiece regularly (once a week) with a dry tissue. Do not use water or liquids when you clean the mouthpiece.

  

## When should I throw away this medication?  

*   The Ellipta comes in an aluminium foil tray. 
*   Once the foil tray is opened, the expiry of Ellipta depends on the type of the Ellipta you are using:  

*   Relvar Ellipta: 1 month 
*   Incruse Ellipta and Anoro Ellipta: 6 weeks 

*   Check the dose counter and change the inhaler once the dose counter indicates zero doses.

## ​What are Easyhalers?

*   Easyhalers are inhaler devices that help deliver a specific amount of medication to your lungs.
*   They are used to deliver medications that are used for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
*   Both asthma and COPD affect the lungs which makes it harder for the person to breathe.   
    

## Why is it important to use Easyhalers correctly?

*   Easyhalers deliver a very small dose of the medication each time, thus you usually do not feel or taste anything after a dose.
*   Hence, it is important to use the Easyhaler correctly to get the full dosage and benefit from the medication.
*   This allows the medication to have a higher chance of reaching the small airways, which increases the effectiveness of the medication and helps reduce any side effects.  
    

## How do Easyhalers work?

Each Easyhaler consists of a plastic device that contains dry powdered medication. It is activated by breath. This means that when you inhale, the Easyhaler automatically releases the medication.

## How should I take/use Easyhalers?  

  

**​Steps**   

**​Description**  

​1  

​Hold the Easyhaler in one hand and remove the cover with the other hand  

​2  

​Shake the Easyhaler up and down 3 to 5 times.  

​3  

​Hold the Easyhaler upright between your thumb and index finger.  

​4  

​Press down once on the coloured button with your index finger until you hear a  ‘click’ sound.  

​5  

​Release your finger. The dose is now ready for use.   

​6  

​Breathe out normally away from the Easyhaler. Do not breathe into the Easyhaler.  

​7  

​Put the mouthpiece in your mouth and seal your lips around the mouthpiece.  

​8  

​Breathe in as steadily and deeply as you can until your lungs are full.  

​9  

​Remove the Easyhaler from your mouth and hold your breath for at least 5 seconds, Then breathe out slowly away from the mouthpiece with your mouth.  

​10  

​If another dose is required, repeat steps 1 to 9 after 1 minute.  

​11  

​Replace the cover after use.  

​12  

​The last 20 doses will appear in red.  

​13  

If your Easyhaler contain a steroid, please rinse your mouth with water after use to prevent oral fungal infection.   

##   

## What should I avoid when using Easyhalers?  

*   Do not click the Easyhaler more than once. If you accidentally click the Easyhaler more than once, you need to empty the powder out by tapping the mouthpiece on a table or the palm of your hand before repeating from Step 2.
*   Do not blow into the Easyhaler or immerse it into water.

If you have problems remembering your doses, speak to your pharmacist or doctor.

## What precautions should I take?  

Inform your healthcare professional if:

*   You are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication
    
*   You are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding. If you are pregnant and/or breastfeeding, your doctor would have discussed the potential benefits and side effects with you and should you have further questions or concerns, do consult your doctor.
    
*   You are taking any other medications including over-the-counter medications, supplements, traditional Chinese medicine and herbal remedies. Some of them may affect how this medication works or cause serious drug interactions.
    
*   You have diabetes. Clozapine may sometimes worsen blood sugar control in diabetes. Maintain regular check-ups with your doctor.
    
*   You are smoking. Smoking may decrease the amount of clozapine that stays in your body.
    

*   You have or have ever had:
    
    *   Other drug allergies
        
    *   Medical conditions such as:

        *   Seizures (fits), glaucoma, high or low blood pressure, Parkinson’s disease, dementia
            

**IMPORTANT:**

In rare cases, clozapine can cause agranulocytosis, a condition whereby there is a significant reduction in your white blood cells (WBC). This can lead to serious or sometimes life-threatening infections. Symptoms may include fever, sore throat and/or mouth ulcers that do not go away.

To prevent this from happening, your doctor will monitor the levels of your WBC with regular blood tests while you are on clozapine treatment – weekly for the first 18 weeks after starting treatment, then at least monthly thereafter.

If your WBC levels drop too low, your doctor may stop clozapine treatment. WBC levels usually return to normal after stopping clozapine. **Do not restart clozapine without your doctor’s advice.**

It is therefore important to keep all appointments with your doctor – taking clozapine without regular blood tests can be very dangerous.

Be sure that your family or caregiver are also aware of the above symptoms so they can call your doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.

title: Accuhalers
url_slug: Accuhalers
keywords: Accuhaler,
```

## What are Accuhalers?  

*   Accuhalers are inhaler devices that help deliver a specific amount of medication to your lungs.
*   They are used to deliver medications that are used for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
*   Both asthma and COPD affect the lungs which makes it harder for the person to breathe.   
    

## Why is it important to use Accuhalers correctly?

*   Accuhalers deliver a very small dose of the medication each time, thus you usually do not feel or taste anything after a dose.
*   Hence, it is important to use the Accuhaler correctly to get the full dosage and benefit from the medication.
*   This allows the medication to have a higher chance of reaching the small airways, which increases the effectiveness of the medication and helps reduce any side effects.  
    

## How do Accuhalers work?

Each Accuhaler consists of a plastic device that contains dry powdered medication. When you slide the lever on the thumb grip, a dose is made available. It is activated by breath. This means that when you inhale, the Accuhaler automatically releases the medication.

## How should I take/use Accuhalers?  

  

**​Steps**  

**​Description**  

​1  

​Hold the Accuhaler in one hand and put the thumb of your other hand on the thumb grip.  

​2  

​Open the Accuhaler by pushing the thumb grip away from you as far as it will go until you hear a click.  

​3  

​Hold the Accuhaler with the mouthpiece towards you.  

​4  

​Push the lever away from you until you hear a click.  

​5  

​Breathe out gently and completely, away from the Accuhaler.  

​6  

​Place the mouthpiece in your mouth and seal tightly with your lips.  

​7  

Breathe in steadily and deeply. You may taste some sweetness in your mouth, which is normal.  

​8  

​Remove the Accuhaler from your mouth and hold your breath for about 10 seconds or as long as you can.  

​9  

​Breathe out slowly through your mouth, away from the Accuhaler.   

​10  

​Close the Accuhaler by sliding back the thumb grip back to its original position. It is ready for use again.  

​11  

​If another dose is required, repeat steps 1 to 10 after 1 minute.  

​12  

​If the dose indicator shows red, there are 5 doses left.  

​13  

​If your Accuhaler contains a steroid, please rinse your mouth with water after use to prevent oral fungal infection.

url_slug: Soliqua
keywords: Soliqua,insulin glargine,Lixisenatide,
```

## What is this medication for?  

Soliqua® is an injection that contains two medications: Insulin Glargine and Lixisenatide.

   

These medications help to control diabetes.  

  

Insulin glargine is long-acting and helps to lower blood sugar throughout the day.  

  

Lixisenatide works by slowing the movement of food from your stomach to the small intestine, hence slowing down absorption of sugars into the body. It also regulates the amount of insulin made by your body in a sugar-dependent manner. 

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   Soliqua® is to be injected once a day
*   Soliqua® should be injected 1 hour before meal, preferably the same meal every day, with the most convenient meal
*   Inject Soliqua® into the fatty tissue that is between the skin and muscle layer on the upper arms, thighs or tummy (abdomen).
*   Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse and as described in the manual. 
*   Ensure that the liquid is clear and colourless before use. 
*   Do not use it if it appears cloudy, grainy or if particles are seen.   
    

You may refer to [this article](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/Insulin-Injection-Technique) for more details on insulin injection techniques.  

  

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

If you missed a dose, inject the next dose at the usual time the following day.

   

Do not inject two doses at the same time. 

  

## What precautions should I take?

Inform your healthcare professional if you:  

*   Are allergic to this medication or any of the ingredients in this medication
*   Are eating less than usual due to sickness or dietary changes as your dosage may need to be changed
*   Are travelling across different time zones. You might need to adjust the number of meals and the dose of your insulin based on where you travel to.
*   Are pregnant, planning to become pregnant or breastfeeding
*   Have stomach or intestinal problems or delayed stomach emptying (gastroparesis) 
*   Have or have had problems with your pancreas or stones in your gallbladder
*   Have kidney or liver problems

  

## What are some common side-effects of this medication?

Like all medications, this medication may cause some possible side effects but not everyone experiences them. Consult your healthcare professional if any of the side effects becomes severe and bothersome.  

  

The common side effects of Glargine and Lixisenatide include:

*   Nausea  
    
*   Vomiting
*   Diarrhoea 
*   Stuffy or runny nose
*   Sore throat
*   Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)

  

This medication may cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Symptoms of low blood sugar include:  

*   Weakness 
*   Dizziness   
    
*   Hunger 
*   Sweating 
*   Trembling 
*   Blurred vision 
*   Walking unsteadily 
*   Fast heartbeat 

  

If you experience any of these low blood sugar symptoms, do the following immediately: 

Step 1: Check your blood sugar level with a home blood sugar meter (glucometer) if available. If your blood sugar level is less than 4 mmol/L, take 15 grams of fast-acting sugar. Examples of 15 grams of fast-acting sugar include:

*   3 glucose tablets or 
*   Half a glass of fruit juice (200ml) or
*   Half a can of soft drink or sweetened drink (175ml) or
*   1 can of less sugar soft drink (330ml) or
*   3 teaspoons of sugar, honey or syrup

  

Step 2: Monitor yourself for 15 minutes. If you have a glucometer (home blood sugar meter), check your blood sugar level again after 15 minutes. 

  

Step 3: If your blood sugar level is still less than 4 mmol/L or you still have symptoms of low blood sugar, you should take another 15 grams of fast-acting sugar as per Step 1.

  

If your symptoms do not go away, see a doctor or go to the hospital immediately.

  

Step 4: Take your meal or snack if your blood sugar level is 4 mmol/L and above after consuming the fast-acting sugar earlier on. 

  

Inform your doctor about your low blood sugar event during your next clinic visit.

Low blood sugar may occur if you: 

*   Inject too much insulin
*   Do not eat on time, miss your meals or change your diet
*   Exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal
*   Do not eat well due to an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting)
*   Drink alcohol on an empty stomach while injecting insulin
*   Have kidney or liver problems which have worsened  
    

  

Some patients may also experience mild pain, redness, bruising, swelling, a small lump or dent of the skin at the injection site.

*   Do not reuse your needles, rotate injection sites within the recommended areas and use shorter needles (4mm or 6mm) to reduce the chances of developing such reactions.   
    
*   They also usually go away in a few days to a few weeks. 
*   See a doctor if you frequently experience this. Your injection technique may need to be reviewed. 

  

## What are some rare but serious side-effects for which I need to seek medical advice immediately?

*   Nausea or vomiting that does not go away
*   Fever  
    

See a doctor or go to the hospital immediately if your blood sugar level is always low (less than 4 mmol/L) or you continue to experience symptoms of low blood sugar even after taking some sugar (see instructions above for management of low blood sugar).

  

## What food or medication should I avoid when I take this medication?

You should avoid taking alcohol with this medication as this may increase your risk of having low blood sugar.

title: Smoking Cessation - Addressing Your Barriers to Quit Smoking!
url_slug: Smoking-Cessation
keywords: NRT,nicotine,Nicorette,Nicotinell,
```

## 1\. If I quit smoking immediately, I may die earlier!

Compared to a non-smoker, an average smoker loses about 14 years of life. In a smoke-free person, 95% of that additional time will be spent without disability.

Quitting smoking not only extends disability-free life, it also shortens the health problems acquired previously from smoking.

**Related: ["Vaping is not smoking", and Other Tobacco Myths](https://www.healthhub.sg/live-healthy/Vaping-is-not smoking-and-Other-Tobacco-Myths)**

## 2\. I’m too old to quit smoking because it's too late — the damage is already done!

Quitting smoking is never too late! At any age, the sooner you quit, the sooner your health can improve. Continuing to smoke at an old age increases the impairment of mental health.

The sooner you quit, the more you can reduce your chances of getting cancer and other diseases. The moment you choose to quit smoking, your body starts to heal within 20 minutes. After 2 to 5 years, your risk for stroke is similar to that of a non-smoker. In 10-15 years, your lung cancer risk is reduced by 50% and your risk of heart diseases is similar.

**Related: [Smoking Control Programmes for Adults](https://www.healthhub.sg/live-healthy/Tobacco and tax "Smoking Control Programmes for Adults")**

## 3\. I have cut down my number of sticks. Just a few sticks a day won’t hurt.

One cigarette contains more than 7,000 chemicals and compounds, of which 1% are known carcinogens.  

Hence, each cigarette you smoke hurts your lungs, your blood vessels, and cells throughout your body, increasing the risk of cancer. Cutting back is not enough to protect you. You have to quit entirely.

**Related: [Smoking Increases Your Risk of Diabetes](https://www.healthhub.sg/live-healthy/smoking-increases-your-risk-of-diabetes "Smoking Increases Your Risk of Diabetes")**

## 4\. I’m smoking ‘filter’ or ‘light’ cigarette which is less harmful.

There is no standard definition of what constitutes a light or ultra-light brand. These may refer to the perceived taste and flavour of cigarettes but not their content. Such misleading labels are no longer allowed. Many light, or ultra-light cigarette smokers may also unconsciously compensate by smoking more or inhaling smoke harder and deeper into the lungs.

Filters do not protect you. They are designed to make smoke particles smaller. That makes nicotine easier to absorb, which in turn increases addiction.

**Related: [Questions on Smoking, Tobacco Use, and Health](https://www.healthhub.sg/live-healthy/questions_smoking "Questions on Smoking, Tobacco Use, and Health")**

## 5\. I tried quitting and failed, so it’s no use trying again.

The most important thing is not to give up on yourself! Breaking smoking addiction is harder for some people than others. Quitting can take several tries. For some smokers, smoking may actually be a habit or a form of mood reliever rather than an addiction.

Many people who are serious about quitting made several attempts before they quit completely. You can speak to a pharmacist if you need help to quit smoking.

**Related: [Quitting Smoking — The Supporter’s Guide](https://www.healthhub.sg/live-healthy/quittingsmokingthesupportersguide_pdf "Quitting Smoking — The Supporter's Guide")**

## 6\. Smoking cessation medications don’t help!

Some medications, such as nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs), helps to reduce withdrawal symptoms associated with quitting smoking while you focus on resolving other issues that are causing you to smoke. NRTs also help to eliminate the intake of more than 7000 chemicals found in cigarettes.

Commitment to quitting smoking is an important step, but you are more likely to succeed at quitting if you take advantage of smoking cessation medications with the assistance of a medical professional. Feel free to speak to a pharmacist regarding medications used to help quit smoking!

**Related: [5 Fast Facts about Nicotine Replacement Therapy](https://www.healthhub.sg/live-healthy/5-fast-facts-about-nicotine-replacement-therapy "5 Fast Facts about Nicotine Replacement Therapy")**

## 7\. I will feel worse after quitting.

It is true that you may feel uncomfortable during the quitting process as withdrawal symptoms may occur. However, this is only temporary as your body is in the process of healing itself.

Here are some reasons why you feel this way:

**Symptoms**

**Rationale**

Coughing

Lungs are clearing away tar, dead cells and extra mucus.

Light-headedness or Dizziness

Body is getting extra oxygen and lesser carbon monoxide.

Headache

Constipation/Stomach Pain

Intestinal movements may slow down for a brief period.

Fatigue

Body takes time to adjust to the lack of stimulation from nicotine.

Difficulty Concentrating

Increased Appetite

Sense of taste and smell improves.

Tingling in Hands and Feet

Blood circulation improves with more supply of oxygen to the fingers and toes.

Meanwhile, you can also cope with cravings of smoking using the 4 ‘Ds’:

*   **D**elay lighting up.
    
*   **D**istract oneself by doing something else that you like to do.
    
*   **D**eep breathing exercises.
    
*   **D**rink sips of water.

title: Alfuzosin
url_slug: Alfuzosin
keywords: Alfuzosin,Xatral,Ranfuzosin,
```

## ​What is this medication for?

Alfuzosin  belongs to a group of medications known as alpha-1 blockers. It is used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia, a condition where the prostate gland is enlarged due to a non-cancerous growth and this is caused by overproduction of a hormone called dihydrotestosterone. The prostate is close to the bladder, therefore enlargement of the prostate gland can affect the flow of urine. This leads to urinary symptoms such as a weak or interrupted urine flow, frequent or urgent need to urinate. The medication works by relaxing the muscles of the prostate gland and bladder exit to help relieve these symptoms.

  

This medication may also be used for other conditions. Check with your healthcare professional if you are unsure why you are given this medication.

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.
*   This medication should be taken after food 
*   Do not crush or chew the tablet as this can affect the release of medication into your body.
*   The first tablet of a new dose should be taken at bedtime, and subsequently at the same time each day.  
    

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Then take your next dose at the usual time. Do not take two doses to make up for the missed dose.

  

## What precautions should I take?

Inform your healthcare professional if: 

*   You are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication
*   You have heart problems
*   You ever feel dizzy or faint when you stand up, or if you have ever fainted after passing urine
*   You are undergoing cataract (cloudiness of the lens) eye surgery. Inform your eye specialist before the operation that you are taking or have previously taken the medication. The pupil may dilate poorly and the iris (the coloured part of the eye) may become floppy during the operation. It is important for the eye specialist to be aware of this as the operation may need to be carried out differently. 
*   You are taking medications belonging to PDE-5 Inhibitors class such as Sildenafil, Tadalafil or Vardenafil,  for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, a condition where you are unable to get or keep an erection firm enough to have sexual intercourse.

keywords: 
```

## What is this medication for?

Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (anti-TNFα) belongs to a class of medications called biologics or more specifically, biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARD).

Biologics work by blocking targeted parts of the immune system that cause inflammation in the body.

Anti-TNFα targets and blocks the effect of TNF. This reduces inflammation and flares, improves symptoms and quality of life, and prevents disease progression.

There are many anti-TNFα drugs available including adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, golimumab and infliximab. It may be used alone (monotherapy) or together with other DMARDs.

Biologics are more costly compared to conventional DMARDs. Your doctor may discuss with you if there is a biosimilar (non-branded version of the original biologic) which works the same way as biologics at a more affordable cost.

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   It may be given as
    
    *   subcutaneous injection (inject under the skin, into areas like the abdomen or thigh) such as adalimumab and golimumab. This can be injected by yourself or a caregiver at home.
        
    *   intravenous infusion (inject into the blood vessel) such as infliximab. This has to be done in the hospital for typically 2 to 4 hours.
        
*   Do not stop using your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.
    
*   Other medications such as corticosteroids (e.g. prednisolone) or disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may be taken with anti-TNFα.
    

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

Different biologics have different intervals between doses. If you forget to inject a dose, do it as soon as you remember. Then inject your next dose at the usual time. Do not administer two doses to make up for the missed dose. DO check with your healthcare professional if unsure.

If you miss your infusion appointment, book another appointment as soon as possible. Inform your doctor about the missed/ late dose.

## What precautions should I take?

Inform your healthcare professional if:

*   You are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication.
    
*   You plan to start a family or to breastfeed. Certain biologics may be safer than others in pregnancy.
    
*   You are taking any other medications, including over-the-counter medicines, supplements, traditional medications and herbal remedies.
    
*   You have any heart problems. Your doctor may want to monitor your heart condition more closely after starting anti-TNFα.
    

Avoid overcrowded places and stay away from people who are sick to prevent getting an infection.

Reactivation of infections such as tuberculosis (TB) and hepatitis B may happen when you are on this medication, hence, your doctor will check for such infections before starting anti-TNFα.

## What are some common side-effects of this medication?

*   Infection (common cold, sinusitis, urinary tract infections and skin infections)
    
    *   If you develop a fever, sore throat, pain on urination or feel generally unwell, see a doctor immediately. Tell the doctor whom you consult that you are on anti-TNFα.
        
*   Injection site reactions: symptoms include bruising, redness, itching, pain and swelling
    
    *   If you are using subcutaneous injection, rotate the injection site each time. You may also apply a cold pack to the injection site after injection.
        
    *   These symptoms are temporary and usually go away within 3 to 5 days.
        
*   Infusion reactions: symptoms include flushing, chills, chest tightness, shortness of breath, hypotension or hypertension
    
    *   Medications may be given before the infusion to prevent these reactions.
        
    *   You will be monitored closely in the ward during and after the infusion
        
        *   Inform the nurse immediately if you experience any of these symptoms.
            
        *   Your infusion may be slowed down or stopped if the symptoms are severe.
            
*   Low blood cell count (platelet, red and/or white blood cell)
    
*   Headache
    
*   Rash
    

It is important to monitor the effects of your new treatment, particularly during the first few months of treatment. If the symptoms persist or are severe, consult your doctor. You may need to have regular blood tests to monitor your blood counts while on this medication.

## What are some rare but serious side-effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?

keywords: Sun,sunburn,sunscreen,sunblock,
```

## What is sun damage?

Over exposure to the sun and artificial ultraviolet (UV) radiation can cause sunburn, skin and eye damage, premature aging, wrinkling, brown pigmentation and cancer.

UV radiation can pass through water, and clouds do not block out UV radiation.

Your skin becomes more tanned as a response to sun damage and will start to become darker. The outer layers become thicker in order to provide better protection against sun rays. However, the harmful rays are still able to get through this natural barrier. That is why additional protection is important to prevent damage to the deeper layers of your skin.

Certain medications can also increase your skin’s sensitivity to the sun, some examples include:

*   Certain Antibiotics (eg. Doxycycline, Ciprofloxacin)
    
*   Certain blood pressure medications (eg. Hydrochlorothiazide)
    
*   Certain acne medications (Eg. Isotretinoin)
    
*   Ketoprofen gel
    

## How to prevent sun damage?

*   Frequently apply sunscreen with Sun Protection Factor (SPF) 30 or higher to maintain protection
    
    *   Dry your skin well before applying sunscreen
        
    *   Apply sunscreen 20 to 30 minutes before going into the sun
        
    *   Apply sunscreen generously and evenly over the exposed areas of the whole body
        
    *   Wait for the sunscreen to dry before putting on your clothes or makeup
        
    *   If you apply non-water resistant sunscreen, you should reapply it after every swim or after heavy perspiration. Make sure your skin is dry first before applying.
        
    *   If you apply water-resistant sunscreen, you should reapply it every two hours or every hour if you have been swimming.
        
*   Wear sun-protective clothing
    
*   Put on a hat to protect your scalp and face
    
*   Avoid prolonged exposure to the sun
    
*   Wear sunglasses to protect your eyes
    
*   Use SPF-containing lip balm on your lips

## What is this medication for?

Brinzolamide belongs to a class of medications called carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, which is used to treat glaucoma. Glaucoma is a condition where the nerve in the eye is damaged, and is usually associated with increased eye pressure. Untreated glaucoma can affect your eyesight and cause blindness. Brinzolamide helps to lower the pressure in your eye by reducing production of fluid in the eye.

  

## How should I take/use this medication?  

*   Proper use of eye drop

*   Wash your hands with soap and water, and read the instructions on the label.
*   Shake the bottle.
*   Tilt your head backwards and look up.
*   Gently pull the lower eyelid down to form a pocket and squeeze the bottle to apply one drop into your eye. To prevent the tip of the bottle from getting dirty, make sure the tip does not touch the eye or any other surface.
*   Close your eyes gently and wipe off any excess eye drops around your eyes with a clean tissue.
*   Keep your eyes closed and press down gently on the inner corner of your eye for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the medication to be absorbed.
*   If you need to use more than 1 drop of medication, or if you are using another type of eye drop, wait at least 5 to 10 minutes before applying the next eye drop. This is to prevent the first drop of medication from being washed away by the second drop before it has time to work. This also prevents any medication interactions between different eye drops.
*   If your doctor prescribed both eye drops and eye ointments, you should use the eye drops first. 
*   Click on this link for a step-by-step guide on how to apply eye drops [https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/A-Step-By-Step-Guide-On-How-To-Instil-Eye-Drops](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/A-Step-By-Step-Guide-On-How-To-Instil-Eye-Drops)  
    

*   For contact lens wearers  
    

*   Remove your contact lens before each application of medication.
*   When using hard lens, you can put them on directly after applying the eye drops.
*   When using soft lens, you can put them on 30 minutes after applying the eye drops. Otherwise, your lens may be damaged by the preservatives present in the eye drops.
*   If you need to apply eye drops twice a day, it is recommended that you apply them once in the morning before you put on your lens, and at the end of the day after you remove your lens.  
    

*   Do not stop using your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.

```

## Introduction

Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (VVC) is also known as vaginal thrush. It affects nearly 75% of all adult women at least once in their lifetime.

## What is vulvovaginal candidiasis (vvc) and what causes it?

VVC is a yeast infection that is usually caused by _Candida albicans_. _Candida_ is often found in the vagina without causing any symptoms. When an imbalance occurs, _Candida_ can multiply and cause symptoms of VVC.

In most cases of VVC, it develops for no apparent reason. However, certain factors can increase your risk of developing VVC:

*   Use of certain medications such as antibiotics or high-estrogen oral contraceptives.
    
*   Pregnancy.
    
*   Poorly controlled diabetes.
    
*   Weakened immune system – for example, people on chemotherapy or steroids, patients with certain cancers.
    

## What are the symptoms?

### Vaginal Discharge

The discharge from VVC is usually creamy white and quite thick, but can be watery sometimes. The discharge does not usually smell.

### Pain and Itch

Some women may experience pain or discomfort whilst having sex or passing urine as a symptom of vaginal thrush. Itching, redness, discomfort or pain of the vulva area is also possible.

## What are the treatment options?

### Topical Treatments

These are pessaries and creams which you insert into the vagina with or without an applicator. They contain anti-fungal medicines such as _clotrimazole_, _econazole_ or _isoconazole_. A single dose of pessary inserted into the vagina is usually sufficient to clear a bout of thrush. However, some may also want to apply anti-fungal cream onto the skin around the vagina. All anti-fungal vaginal pessaries and creams essentially work the same way and show no differences in effectiveness.

Combination topical preparation of an anti-fungal with steroid is available and especially helpful if discomfort and itch of the vulva area is disturbing. You can obtain topical treatments without a prescription at pharmacies. Some reported side effects of these medicines are mild burning sensation, itching and redness. Consult your pharmacist or doctor if the symptom persists or become troublesome.

​

If you are pregnant, the use of topical antifungals is generally safe in the second and third trimester, but always consult your doctor or pharmacist first.

_Note: Pessaries and creams may damage latex condoms and diaphragms and affect their use as a contraceptive. You should use alternative methods of contraception during treatment and for at least five days afterwards._

### Oral Medication

_Fluconazole_, an anti-fungal taken by mouth in a single dose can be obtained from pharmacies without a prescription, on the advice of the pharmacist.

Side effects are uncommon; nausea, headache, and abdominal pain have been reported.

![Diflucan](https://ch-api.healthhub.sg/api/public/content/e13561f396f1424ba352ae75ed0b0e70?v=673826ce)

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding,do not use these treatments without medical advice.

You may also consider application of anti-fungal cream onto the skin around the vagina, if discomfort and itch is disturbing.

Oral and topical anti-fungal treatments are thought to be equally effective. Oral medications may be more convenient, but work slightly slower than most topical treatments.

### Others

The following methods may also help relieve the symptoms of VVC:

*   Avoid using perfumed products such as soaps and shower gels around the vaginal area, as these may cause further irritation.
    
*   Use sodium bicarbonate sitz bath for prompt relief of vulva irritation while awaiting onset of antifungal agents. Add 2-4 tablespoons of sodium bicarbonate to 2 inches of warm bath water. Sit in the sitz bath for 15 minutes, 2-3 times in first week, followed by 1-2 times weekly as needed to control symptoms.
    

## Do I need to see a doctor?

Simple and uncomplicated VVC may be treated with self-medication. However, symptoms like vaginal discharge and itch can be due to other causes. Do not assume that all vaginal discharge or itch are due to VVC. Consult a doctor if you:

*   Are under 16 or over 60 years of age.
    
*   Are pregnant.
    
*   Are on certain medications like antibiotics or steroids.
    
*   Have abnormal vaginal bleeding.
    
*   Have symptoms that differ from a previous bout of VVC.
    
*   Have had 4 or more episodes of VVC in the last 12 months.
    
*   Have had a previous sexually transmitted infection.
    
*   Have a weakened immune system.
    
*   Continue to experience symptoms despite use of self-medication.
    

## What can I do to prevent recurrence of VVC?

### Hygiene

The normal conditions of the vagina may be altered by excess washing and rinsing out (douching) of the vagina, bubble baths, scented soaps, etc. As a result, the natural defences in the vagina may be affected, allowing the _Candida_ species to thrive. Therefore, washing the external vaginal area with water and unscented soap is recommended instead.

### Clothes

Tight-fitting clothes often trap heat and moisture, which are favourable conditions for the growth of _Candida_ species. Loose fitting clothing is therefore recommended.

### Sexual Intercourse

VVC is not a sexually transmitted disease. However, friction during sex may cause minor damage to the vagina which promotes growth of _Candida_ species. Well lubrication is therefore recommended during sexual intercourse to avoid the recurrence of VVC.

### Probiotics

Probiotics may help to optimise the conditions in the vagina but the evidence on its role in VVC prevention is lacking. Probiotics can be obtained through foods like yoghurt or supplements.

## ​What is this medication for?

  

Pyrazinamide is an antibiotic that is commonly used together with other medications for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB).

  

Tuberculosis is an infection caused by the bacterium _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. You can get infected by breathing in droplets containing this bacterium that are sprayed into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

  

There are two types of tuberculosis: 

  

1.  Active TB

*   An infection with _M. tuberculosis_ could present with symptoms. It is possible to spread the infection when you have active tuberculosis that is not treated.
*   Common signs and symptoms include coughing for more than three weeks, may be coughing up blood, fever, night sweats, loss of appetite, weight loss, pain in the chest. 
*   Your doctor may do an X-ray of your chest to observe for any unusual signs in your lungs, or a phlegm test to check for the presence of the tuberculosis bacteria under the microscope.
*   Usually treated with a combination of the following four medications: Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Ethambutol and Pyrazinamide. These medications can work together to kill the tuberculosis bacteria.

  

2\. Latent TB

*   An infection with tuberculosis bacteria but with NO symptoms.
*   If you have latent TB, you cannot spread it to another person
*   Usually treated with either Isoniazid or Rifampicin.

  

You might have to take the medication for six to nine months. For active tuberculosis, the first two months usually consists of a combination of the four medications stated above, and the remaining four to seven months is completed using the two medications, Rifampicin and Isoniazid. Do not miss any dose of medication. This may lead to a relapse or worsening of tuberculosis, or a condition with a more resistant form of tuberculosis. In such cases, a longer duration of treatment or use of stronger medications may be needed.

  

Depending on your condition, you may need to attend Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) sessions to help you complete your course of treatment. DOT refers to a healthcare worker or trained volunteer supervising the patient taking each dose of tuberculosis medications. The number of DOT sessions can range from once a day to three times a week.

  

## How should I take/use this medication?  

*   Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.
*   This medication can be taken with or without food. However, if you are having stomach discomfort, you can take them after food instead.
*   Take your medications at the same time every day to maintain the same amount of the medication in your bloodstream. 
*   In children, the medication may be made into a mixture with water before taking.   
    

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

*   If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Then take your next dose at the usual time. Do not take two doses to make up for the missed dose.
*   It is important to complete the entire course of medication, even when you start feeling better during the treatment. This ensures that the tuberculosis bacteria in your body is fully killed.  
    

## What precautions should I take?

Before starting TB treatment, inform your healthcare professional if: 

*   You are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication
*   You have pre-existing medical conditions such as kidney and/or liver problems, gout
*   You consume alcohol regularly
*   You intend to become pregnant (conceive) or breastfeed while taking this medication
*   You are pregnant or breastfeeding
*   If you have active TB, you should stay at home for the first two weeks of your treatment. This is to prevent spreading the bacteria to others, as you are more likely to be able to infect others during this period. If you have close, regular contact with family members or friends, encourage them to visit a doctor to test for TB.
*   If you need to leave the house, wear a surgical mask in public spaces and avoid crowded places. Avoid close contact with anyone who may have low immunity (including elderly, young children, pregnant women).
*   After taking at least two weeks of effective treatment, you are generally considered non-infectious, meaning less likely to infect others, provided that you continue with the rest of the treatment.
*   If you have latent TB, seeing a doctor early and receiving treatment can help to prevent your loved ones from getting active TB in the future.

## What are some common side-effects of this medication?  

You may experience muscle aches and/or joint aches. See a healthcare professional immediately if it gets worse or does not go away.  

  

## What are some rare but serious side-effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?  

If you experience any of these symptoms, you should stop your medication and seek immediate medical attention:

*   Drug allergy symptoms such as swollen face/eyes/lips/tongue, difficulty in breathing, itchy skin rashes over your whole body
*   Signs of liver issues such as dark coloured urine or light coloured stools, nausea and vomiting that does not go away, loss of appetite, stomach pain, yellowing of your eyes or skin
*   Fever, chills, feeling tired or weak (flu-like symptoms)
*   Unexplained bruising or bleeding

There are some tests that are required to better monitor and manage possible side effects from treatment of tuberculosis. These include:  

*   Regular blood tests, especially to monitor your liver function  
    

## What food or medication should I avoid when I take this medication?

*   Avoid alcohol as it may increase the risk of liver problems.
*   It is important that you inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medications – including those for current medical conditions, chronic medications, oral contraceptives (birth control pills), over-the-counter medications, supplements and traditional/herbal remedies – as they may interact with TB medications.

```

## What are Metered Dose Inhalers (MDIs)?

*   Metered Dose Inhalers (MDIs) are inhaler devices that help deliver a fixed amount of medication to your lungs.
*   They are used to deliver medications that are used for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

## Why is it important to use MDIs correctly?  

*   It is important to use MDIs correctly in order to get the full dosage and benefits of the medication.
*   This allows the medication to have a higher chance of reaching the small airways, which increases the effectiveness of the medication and reduces side effects.

## How do MDIs work?

*   Each MDI consists of a pressurized canister of medication and a mouthpiece.
*   Pressing down the canister releases a mist of medication that you breathe into your lungs.
*   It can also be used together with a spacer and/or a mask to help you breathe in your medication better.

## How should I take/use MDIs?  

**​Steps**   

**​Description**  

​1  

​​Remove the cap from the inhaler.  

​2  

​​Shake the inhaler for 3 to 5 seconds.  

​3  

​​If you are using a new inhaler or have not used the inhaler for several days, prepare the device by releasing two puffs of medicine into the air.   

​4  

​​Breathe out gently, away from the inhaler.  

​5  

​Hold the inhaler upright. Place the mouthpiece in your mouth and seal tightly with your lips. Do not bite the mouthpiece.  

​6  

​Start to breathe in slowly and steadily and at the same time.   

​7  

​​Press the canister on the inhaler once to release a dose while continuing to breathe in slowly and deeply through your mouth.   

​8  

​​Remove the inhaler and hold your breath for about 10 seconds or as long as you can.  

​9  

​Breathe out gently away from the inhaler.  

​10  

​If you need to take another puff, wait for 1 minute before repeating steps 4 to 8.  

​11  

​​​Clean the mouthpiece with dry tissue and replace the cap.  

​12  

If you need to use more than one type of inhaler, use the reliever (salbutamol) inhaler first. Wait for at least five minutes before using the next inhaler.   

## What should I avoid when using MDIs?  

*   Holding the inhaler upside down
*   Pressing the inhaler more than once at a time
*   Pressing the inhaler too early or too late
*   Opening your mouth when the jet of the inhaled medication hits the back of your throat.
*   Not inhaling deeply and long enough
*   Not holding your breath long enough

The last 4 problems can be solved by using a spacer. Consult your healthcare professional if you encounter any of these problems.

  

## How should I use a spacer together with the MDIs?  

**​Steps**   

**​Description**   

​1  

​Remove the cap from the inhaler.

​2  

​Shake the inhaler for 3 to 5 seconds  

​3  

​If you are using the MDI for the first time or if MDI has not been used for several days, release 2 puffs into the air to prepare it. 

​4  

​Hold the inhaler upright and attach it to the end of the spacer.  

​5  

​If you are using the spacer for the very first time, prepare it by pressing the inhaler 10 times.  

​6  

​If a mask is used: Attach the mask to the spacer. Place the mask securely over your mouth and nose. Ensure that it fits tightly with no gap between the mask and your face.   
  
If no mask is used: Place the spacer mouthpiece in your mouth and seal tightly with your lips.  

​7  

​Press the canister of the inhaler down once to release one puff of medication into the spacer.  

​8  

​Breathe in and out normally through the spacer for 5 to 10 breaths. Check the technique via the movement of the breathing valve opening and closing for 5 to 6 times.   

​9  

​Alternatively, take a deep breath and hold for about 10 seconds or as long as you can. Then breathe out normally. You do not need to take the spacer out of your mouth to exhale.   

​10  

​If you need to take extra doses, wait for a minute before repeating steps 6 to 8 for each puff. Only one puff should be released into the spacer each time.   

​11  

​If you use more than one type of inhaler through the spacer, use the reliever (Salbutamol) inhaler first, wait for at least 1 to 2 minutes before using the next inhaler.   

​12  

​Remove the spacer from mouth or mask from your face. Wipe clean the mouthpiece of the spacer or facemask.   

​13  

​Remove the inhaler from the spacer and replace the mouthpiece cap.   

Additional counselling points:  

a)      If both controller and reliever are to be used at the same time, you should always use the reliever first followed by the controller, wait for about 1 minute in-between the inhalers.

b)      Please remember to gargle and rinse your mouth with water after using a steroid-containing controller.  

  

## How should I store my MDIs?  

Store in a cool and dry place, away from direct sunlight. Keep this medication away from children.

       

MDIs may or may not include the dose counters to let you know the number of doses left in the MDI. 

*   For MDI with dose counters, throw away the MDI once the dose counter reaches zero.
*   For MDI without dose counters, record the number of doses you use each time. Throw away the MDI once you have used the number of doses stated on the product.  
    

## How should I clean my MDIs?  

**​Steps**   

**​Description**   

​1  

​Only wash MDIs without dose counters. Do not wash MDIs with dose counters.  

​2  

​Remove the metal canister from the external canister holder.   

​3  

​Soak the external canister holder in warm soapy water for about 30 seconds. Alternatively, wash the external holder of the canister under running water.   

​4  

​Shake off excess water and allow the case to air-dry overnight.  

​5  

​Put back the metal canister into the dry plastic case the next day.  

​6  

​Test the inhaler by releasing a puff of medication into the air.  

​7  

​You can wash your MDIs once a week.

## How should I clean my spacer?  

**​Steps**  

**​Description**  

​1  

​Dismantle the spacer (if necessary).

​2  

​Soak the spacer in lukewarm water with few drops of liquid detergent for about 15 minutes. The depth of water should be enough to submerge the spacer with or without the facemask.   
  

Do not scrub the spacer or place the breathing valve of the spacer directly under running water.   

  

Do **NOT** rub dry with a cloth as this will increase the amount of static in the plastic container and may affect the amount of medication that you receive.  

  

Do **NOT** rinse your spacer as the detergent reduces the static charges as well.  

​3  

​Shake off the excess water and leave the spacer to air dry.   

​4  

​You can wash your spacer once a month.   

You may wish to follow the package insert on how to clean your spacer and when to replace your spacer as instructions may be different for each device.  

  

## How should I throw away the MDI safely?  

Pack the spacer into a black trash bag and seal it tightly before throwing into the rubbish chute or bin.

## What is this medication for?  

Travoprost belongs to a class of medications called prostaglandin analogues, which is used to treat glaucoma. Glaucoma is a condition where the nerve in the eye is damaged, and is usually associated with increased eye pressure. Untreated glaucoma can affect your eyesight and cause blindness. Travoprost helps to lower the pressure in your eye by increasing drainage of fluid in the eye.

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   Proper use of eye drop

*   Wash your hands with soap and water, and read the instructions on the label.
*   Tilt your head backwards and look up.
*   Gently pull the lower eyelid down to form a pocket and squeeze the bottle to apply one drop into your eye. To prevent the tip of the bottle from getting dirty, make sure the tip does not touch the eye or any other surface.
*   Close your eyes gently and wipe off any excess eye drops around your eyes with a clean tissue.
*   Keep your eyes closed and press down gently on the inner corner of your eye for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the medication to be absorbed.  
    
*   If you need to use more than 1 drop of medication, or if you are using another type of eye drop, wait at least 5 to 10 minutes before applying the next eye drop. This is to prevent the first drop of medication from being washed away by the second drop before it has time to work. This also prevents any medication interactions between different eye drops.
*   If your doctor prescribed both eye drops and eye ointments, you should use the eye drops first.

title: Turbuhalers
url_slug: Turbuhalers
keywords: Turbuhaler,
```

## ​What are Turbuhalers?

*   Turbuhalers are inhaler devices that help deliver a specific amount of medication to your lungs.
*   They are used to deliver medications that are used for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
*   Both asthma and COPD affect the lungs which makes it harder for the person to breathe.   
    

## Why is it important to use Turbuhalers correctly?

*   Turbuhalers deliver a very small dose of the medication each time, thus you usually do not feel or taste anything after a dose.
*   Hence, it is important to use the Turbuhalers correctly to get the full dosage and benefit from the medication.
*   This allows the medication to have a higher chance of reaching the small airways, which increases the effectiveness of the medication and helps to reduce any side effects.  
    

## How do Turbuhalers work?

Each Turbuhaler consists of a plastic device that contains dry powdered medication. It is activated by breath. This means that when you inhale, the Turbuhaler automatically releases the medication.

## How should I take/use Turbuhalers?

For all Turbuhalers **other than** Symbicort and Pulmicort:  

  

**Steps**

**Description**

1

Unscrew and remove the cap.

2

Hold the Turbuhaler upright with base downwards.

3

Twist the base as far as possible in one direction.

4

Twist it back in the opposite direction until you hear a click. This means the Turbuhaler is primed and ready for use.

5

Breathe out gently, away from the Turbuhaler.

6

Place the mouthpiece in your mouth and seal tightly with your lips.

7

Breathe in forcefully and deeply with your mouth.

8

Remove the inhaler and hold your breath for about 10 seconds or as long as you can.

9

Breathe out slowly, away from the inhaler.

10

If another dose is required, repeat steps 2 to 9 after 1 minute.

11

Replace the cap.

12  

Turbuhalers feature either a dose counter to show the exact number of doses left or a red indicator at the side of the device. Consult your healthcare professional if you are unsure.  

For **Symbicort and Pulmicort:**

**Steps**

**Description**

1

Unscrew and remove the cap.

2

Hold the inhaler upright with base downwards.

3

Twist the base as far as possible in one direction.

4

Twist it back in the opposite direction until you hear a click.

5

Repeat steps 3 and 4 again for one time. The inhaler is now ready for use, and you should not repeat this procedure again.

6

To take a dose, twist the base as far as possible in one direction.

7

Twist it back in the opposite direction until you hear a click.  

This means that for the first dose, you will hear a total of 3 clicks. For subsequent doses, you should only hear one click.

8

Breathe out gently, away from the inhaler.

9

Place the mouthpiece in your mouth and seal tightly with your lips.

10

Breathe in forcefully and deeply.

11

Remove the inhaler and hold your breath for about 10 seconds or as long as you can.

Breathe out slowly through your mouth, away from the inhaler.

13

If another dose is required, repeat steps 6 to 12 after 1 minute.

14

Replace the cap.

15

Symbicort is marked in intervals of ten doses, starting from either 60 or 120 when full. For the last ten doses, the background of the indicator is red. Consult your healthcare professional if you are unsure.

For Pulmicort, a red mark will appear at the top of the indicator window when there are approximately twenty doses left. The inhaler should be discarded when the red mark has reached the bottom of the indicator window

16

If your Turbuhaler contains a steroid, please rinse your mouth with water after use to prevent oral fungal infection.

## What should I avoid when using Turbuhalers?

*   Not holding the Turbuhaler upright while turning the base – if the Turbuhaler is not held upright as you turn the base, it will not deliver a full dose.
*   Do not blow into the Turbuhaler or immerse it into water.
*   Do not continue using the Turbuhaler after the last dose is delivered even if you hear powder when you shake the Turbuhaler. The powder is the drying agent and not the medication.  
    

## How should I store Turbubalers?  

Store in a cool and dry place, away from direct sunlight. Keep this medication away from children.

title: Biologics and Biosimilars
url_slug: Biologics-and-Biosimilars
keywords: 
```

## What is biologic and biosimilar?

Biosimilars are the non-branded versions of the original biologic. Original reference biologics are usually more expensive because of the high cost of researching and manufacturing them, therefore biosimilars can be marketed once the patent on the original biologic has expired.   

  

Biosimilars are comparable in terms of quality, safety and efficacy to their version of an approved original biologics but are more affordable. 

  

Both biologics and biosimilars are one kind of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (also known as “DMARDs”). They reduce uncontrolled immune processes and inflammation in your joints, skin, muscles and gut. This improves symptoms, reduces flares, stops disease progression and improves quality of life. 

  

The term “biologic” or “biosimilar” simply means the medications are derived from animal or human proteins and not from chemicals (unlike other medications). They are highly effective medications that have been used for years.

  

## How do biologics and biosimilar work?

Biologics target specific parts of the immune system. It can block actions of specific types of immune cells such as white blood cells called T-cell or B-cell. It can also block specific proteins in the immune system such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL) 17-A, IL-12, IL-23, IL-6, interferon and CD-20 (protein found on B-cell). These cells or proteins are known to be involved in the inflammation processes implicated in various medical conditions.  

Common examples of biologics  

​TNF-alpha blocker  

​IL-1 blocker  

​IL-6 blocker  

​IL-17 blocker  

​IL-23 blocker  

​IL-12/23 blocker  

​B-cell blocker  

​T-cell blocker  

​Integrin receptor blocker  

Adalimumab

Certolizumab

Etanercept

Golimumab

Infliximab  

​Anakinra, Canakinumab Rilonacept  

​Tocilizumab  

​Ixekinumab

Secukinumab  

​Guselkumab

Risankizumab  

  

​Ustekinumab  

​Belimumab

Rituximab

  
  

  

​Abatacept  

​Vedolizumab  

  

## What are biologics and biosimilars used for?

They are indicated in a wide range of medical conditions such as:

*   Ankylosing spondylitis (AS)
*   Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as Crohn’s Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC)
*   Juvenile (children) arthritis
*   Multiple sclerosis (MS)
*   Psoriasis
*   Psoriatic arthritis (PsA)
*   Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
*   Scleroderma

## How should I take/use this medication?  

Biologics and biosimilars are given by subcutaneous injection (injected into fat tissue under the skin) or intravenous infusion (injected directly into a vein) because these proteins can be damaged by stomach acid if given by mouth. Infusions will require administration by a healthcare professional in a hospital or clinic while self-injection can be performed by a patient or caregiver at home.  

  

The injection may be given daily, weekly, every few weeks or every year. Your doctor will discuss with you which biologic or biosimilar is most appropriate for you, how to give and how often to be given.  

  

## What are the side-effects of this medication?  

​Side effects for biologics and biosimilars  

**​Common > 10%**

*   Infections such as cold, upper respiratory infection, sinusitis
*   Mild injection site reactions such as redness and pain  
    

​**Uncommon 1-3%**

*   Severe infection requiring hospitalisation 
*   Severe infusion reactions

​**Rare < 1 in 1000**

*   Tuberculosis (TB)
*   Shingles
*   Hepatitis B
*   Cancer of the blood, skin or lung
*   Immune diseases such as lupus-like syndrome  
    

*   Increased risk of infection such as upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), urinary tract infection (UTI) and skin infections. If you develop a fever, sore throat, pain on urination or feel generally unwell, see a doctor immediately.
*   Reactivation of certain infectious diseases such as Hepatitis B or Tuberculosis (TB). Your doctor will order tests to assess your risk and decide on treatment before starting a biologic or biosimilar. In addition, your doctor will ensure your vaccination status is updated to further reduce your risk of getting an infection. 
*   Increased risk of certain cancer such as lymphoma (cancer of the blood cell), skin and lung. Your doctor will examine you regularly and order tests when necessary for monitoring.

## ​What is this medication for?  

Ethambutol is an antibiotic that is commonly used together with other medications for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB).  

Tuberculosis is an infection caused by the bacterium _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. You can get infected by breathing in droplets containing this bacterium that are sprayed into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes.  

  

There are two types of tuberculosis: 

  

1.  Active TB

*   An infection with _M. tuberculosis_ could present with symptoms. It is possible to spread the infection when you have active tuberculosis that is not treated.
*   Common signs and symptoms include coughing for more than three weeks, may be coughing up blood, fever, night sweats, loss of appetite, weight loss, pain in the chest.   
    
*   Your doctor may do an X-ray of your chest to observe for any unusual signs in your lungs, or a phlegm test to check for the presence of the tuberculosis bacteria under the microscope.
*   Usually treated with a combination of the following four medications: Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Ethambutol and Pyrazinamide. These medications can work together to kill the tuberculosis bacteria.  
    

2\. Latent TB

*   An infection with tuberculosis bacteria but with NO symptoms.
*   If you have latent TB, you cannot spread it to another person
*   Usually treated with either Isoniazid or Rifampicin.  
    

You might have to take the medication for six to nine months. For active tuberculosis, the first two months usually consists of a combination of the four medications stated above, and the remaining four to seven months is completed using the two medications, Rifampicin and Isoniazid. Do not miss any dose of medication. This may lead to a relapse or worsening of tuberculosis, or a condition with a more resistant form of tuberculosis. In such cases, a longer duration of treatment or use of stronger medications may be needed.

  

Depending on your condition, you may need to attend Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) sessions to help you complete your course of treatment. DOT refers to a healthcare worker or trained volunteer supervising the patient taking each dose of tuberculosis medications. The number of DOT sessions can range from once a day to three times a week.

  

## How should I take/use this medication?  

*   Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.
*   This medication can be taken with or without food. However, if you are having stomach discomfort, you can take them after food instead. 
*   Take your medications at the same time every day to maintain the same amount of medication in your body.
*   In children, the medication may be made into a mixture with water before taking.  
    

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

*   If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Then take your next dose at the usual time. Do not take two doses to make up for the missed dose.
*   It is important to complete the entire course of medication, even when you start feeling better during the treatment. This ensures that the tuberculosis bacteria in your body is fully killed.  
    

## What precautions should I take?

Before starting TB treatment, inform your healthcare professional if: 

*   You are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication
*   You have pre-existing medical conditions such as kidney and/or liver problems, gout
*   You consume alcohol regularly
*   You intend to become pregnant (conceive) or breastfeed while taking this medication
*   You are pregnant or breastfeeding  
    
*   If you have active TB, you should stay at home for the first two weeks of your treatment. This is to prevent spreading the bacteria to others, as you are more likely to be able to infect others during this period. If you have close, regular contact with family members or friends, encourage them to visit a doctor to test for TB.
*   If you need to leave the house, wear a surgical mask in public spaces and avoid crowded places. Avoid close contact with anyone who may have low immunity (including elderly, young children, pregnant women). 
*   After taking at least two weeks of effective treatment, you are generally considered non-infectious, meaning less likely to infect others, provided that you continue with the rest of the treatment.
*   If you have latent TB, seeing a doctor early and receiving treatment can help to prevent your loved ones from getting active TB in the future.  
    

## What are some rare but serious side-effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?  

If you experience any of these symptoms, you should stop your medication and seek immediate medical attention:

*   Signs of liver issues such as dark coloured urine or light coloured stools, nausea and vomiting that does not go away, loss of appetite, stomach pain, yellowing of your eyes or skin
*   Fever, chills, feeling tired or weak (flu-like symptoms)
*   Unexplained bruising or bleeding
*   Visual changes such as not being able to differentiate between red and green colours, blurred vision, eye pain, loss of vision  
    

There are some tests that are required to better monitor and manage possible side effects from treatment of tuberculosis. These include:  

*   Regular blood tests, especially to monitor your liver function
*   Eye tests to monitor your vision  
    

## What food or medication should I avoid when I take this medication?

It is important that you inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medications – including those for current medical conditions, chronic medications, oral contraceptives (birth control pills), over-the-counter medications, supplements and traditional/herbal remedies – as they may interact with TB medications.

## What is this medication for?

Bimatoprost belongs to a class of medications called prostaglandin analogues, which is used to treat glaucoma. Glaucoma is a condition where the nerve in the eye is damaged, and is usually associated with increased eye pressure. Untreated glaucoma can affect your eyesight and cause blindness. Bimatoprost helps to lower the pressure in your eye by increasing drainage of fluid in the eye.

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   Proper use of eye drop

*   Wash your hands with soap and water, and read the instructions on the label.
*   Tilt your head backwards and look up.
*   Gently pull the lower eyelid down to form a pocket and squeeze the bottle to apply one drop into your eye. To prevent the tip of the bottle from getting dirty, make sure the tip does not touch the eye or any other surface.
*   Close your eyes gently and wipe off any excess eye drops around your eyes with a clean tissue.
*   Keep your eyes closed and press down gently on the inner corner of your eye for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the medication to be absorbed.
*   If you need to use more than 1 drop of medication, or if you are using another type of eye drop, wait at least 5 to 10 minutes before applying the next eye drop. This is to prevent the first drop of medication from being washed away by the second drop before it has time to work. This also prevents any medication interactions between different eye drops.
*   If your doctor prescribed both eye drops and eye ointments, you should use the eye drops first. 
*   Click on this link for a step-by-step guide on how to apply eye drops [https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/A-Step-By-Step-Guide-On-How-To-Instil-Eye-Drops](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/A-Step-By-Step-Guide-On-How-To-Instil-Eye-Drops)

title: Pravastatin
url_slug: Pravastatin
keywords: 
```

## ​What is this medication for?

Pravastatin belongs to the class of medications called Statins (also known as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors). Statins lower the amount of ‘bad cholesterol’ (low density lipoprotein or LDL-cholesterol) and ‘fat’ (triglyceride) in the blood as well as increase the amount of ‘good cholesterol’ (high density lipoprotein or HDL-cholesterol).   

  

High ‘bad cholesterol’ levels can cause your blood vessels to clog up and lead to chest pain (angina), heart attack or stroke. Hence, statins may reduce your risk for heart attack and stroke. 

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional. If you stop taking your medication, your ‘bad cholesterol’ level may rise again.
*   You may take this medication with or without food, at night.  
    

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

If you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, take only the usual dose. Do not double your dose or use extra medication to make up for the missed dose.  

  

## What precautions should I take?  

Inform your healthcare professional if: 

*   You are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication
*   You are allergic to any other statins, or to any other medications 
*   You are pregnant, planning to have a baby or breastfeeding
*   You have liver or kidney problems  
    

## What are some common side-effects of this medication?

Some side effects may include:

*   Mild muscle aches or weakness, or feeling tired

Dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis are chronic skin conditions that cause scaling of the skin, which may or may not be accompanied by itching. Dandruff is a milder form of seborrheic dermatitis, affecting only the scalp, whereas seborrheic dermatitis also affects other parts of the body.​1,2,3,4

## What are the symptoms?

Seborrheic dermatitis appears as irregular inflammed patches with dull, yellowish, greasy large scales, often with itching. It occurs mainly in areas with more oil-producing glands, including the scalp, face, upper chest and upper back. The armpits and groin area may also be affected.1,5

Seborrheic dermatitis in infants is known as cradle cap. This appears as thick yellow crusts on the face and neck, behind the ears, in the folds of skin, and also as a stubborn diaper rash. Cradle cap does not usually cause itching.3

Dandruff on the scalp is diffuse and appears as smaller dry or greasy, white or grey scales with little to no inflammation. Itching is usually present.1,6

​​

## What are the causes?

The cause is not clear, but is linked to a type of yeast that is normally found on human skin. Symptoms come and go, and may worsen with emotional or physical stress, cold weather (during winter months), hormonal changes and illness.2,3,4

​

## Who are affected?

Dandruff is uncommon in children, begins to appear at puberty and becomes more common until the early twenties, then begins to decline. It is uncommon in the middle-aged and elderly.4

Cradle cap mainly affects infants from birth to 3 months old, and usually resolves by the time the infant is 8 to 12 months old.1,3

Seborrheic dermatitis is more common in men and occurs between 30 to 70 years old, with more cases happening between 30 to 40 years old.2,5 Individuals with oily skin, personal or family history of seborrheic dermatitis, rosacea or psoriasis, history of organ transplant, infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, certain neurological and psychiatric disorders including Parkinson's disease, stroke or heart attack, alcohol abuse and those using certain medications including lithium, interferon and psoralen have higher risk of developing dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis.5,6,7,8,9

​

## How are dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis diagnosed?

There is no specific test for diagnosing dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis. Diagnosis is usually based on the person's history and physical examination. Rarely, a skin biopsy may be done to rule out other similar skin conditions.3

​​

## How do i treat dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis?

Dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis are long-term conditions that cannot be cured. However, there are many effective treatments available over-the-counter and from the pharmacy to keep the symptoms under control.

Self-treatment is not recommended if the person affected is less than 2 years old, except in the case of cradle cap. If symptoms do not improve or worsen after 2 weeks of using over-the-counter and pharmacy medicines, see a doctor for further treatment.6

**Cradle cap**

Cradle cap can be treated by washing the scalp daily with a non-medicated baby shampoo. Apply a small amount of baby oil or olive oil to loosen the scales. Gently ​massage the scalp with a soft toothbrush to remove the scales, then shampoo again with a non-medicated baby shampoo. Repeat daily until the thick scale disappears.2,3

**Topical medications**

Dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis can be treated with medicated shampoos. After massaging the shampoo into the scalp, leave on for 5 minutes before rinsing thoroughly and repeating the process. Leaving the shampoo in contact with the scalp for the recommended period of time is important to ensure that the treatment is effective. If one type of shampoo does not improve the condition after 4 to 6 weeks, a different medicated shampoo may be used. 3,10

Medicated shampoos may contain one or a combination of the following medications: zinc pyrithione, selenium sulphide, coal tar, salicylic acid and ketoconazole. Steroid creams may also be applied to relief the itch and inflammation in seborrheic dermatitis. Besides ketoconazole, the other medications may be used in children from 2 years old and above.

Follow closely the instructions of use as stated on the product. Avoid applying medicated shampoos on broken or abraded skin. If the shampoo gets into the eye, flush immediately with plenty of water. If significant skin irritation occurs while using any product, stop using and consult a doctor. 

**Side effects**

**Selenium sulphide** may discolour hair, especially blond, grey or dyed hair. Rinse thoroughly after use to avoid this effect. Frequent use may also result in a residual odour and an oily scalp.6

**Coal tar** has an odour that may be considered unpleasant. It can stain the skin and hair, especially light-coloured and artificially bleached hair. It may also stain clothing and jewelry. Avoid sun exposure to the scalp and other parts of the body where coal tar has been applied. There is a small risk that coal tar may increase the risk of skin cancer. Avoid using over a large area of the body or for prolonged periods unless instructed by your doctor.1,4,11,12

When large amounts of a product containing **salicylic acid** is used, significant absorption into the body may occur, causing toxicity with symptoms including nausea, vomitting and ringing in the ears. Avoid using these products over large areas of the body.4,13

**Ketoconazole** should not be used in children below 12 years old. Side effects include acne, hair loss, abnormal hair colour or texture and oiliness or dryness of hair and scalp.14,15

Excessive and prolonged use of **steroid creams** may cause thinning of the skin, acne, excessive hair growth, pigmentation changes and stretch marks. They may also cause increase in blood sugar levels and affect certain hormones in the body, resulting in a symptom of 'moon-face' with a condition known as Cushing's syndrome. To prevent these, apply a thin layer of the cream no more than twice a day, and for not more than seven consecutive days. Avoid applying to large areas of the body.1,6,16

## ​What is this medication for?

Rosuvastatin belongs to the class of medications called Statins (also known as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors). Statins lower the amount of ‘bad cholesterol’ (low density lipoprotein or LDL-cholesterol) and ‘fat’ (triglyceride) in the blood as well as increase the amount of ‘good cholesterol’ (high density lipoprotein or HDL-cholesterol). 

  

High ‘bad cholesterol’ levels can cause your blood vessels to clog up and lead to chest pain (angina), heart attack or stroke. Hence, statins may reduce your risk for heart attack and stroke. 

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional. If you stop taking your medication, your ‘bad cholesterol’ level may rise again.
*   You may take this medication with or without food.

```

## ​What is this medication for?

Lovastatin belongs to the class of medications called Statins (also known as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors). Statins lower the amount of ‘bad cholesterol’ (low density lipoprotein or LDL-cholesterol) and ‘fat’ (triglyceride) in the blood as well as increase the amount of ‘good cholesterol’ (high density lipoprotein or HDL-cholesterol). 

  

High ‘bad cholesterol’ levels can cause your blood vessels to clog up and lead to chest pain (angina), heart attack or stroke. Hence, statins may reduce your risk for heart attack and stroke.   

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional. If you stop taking your medication, your ‘bad cholesterol’ level may rise again.
*   You should take this medication with or after food, at night.  
    

  

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

If you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, take only the usual dose. Do not double your dose or use extra medication to make up for the missed dose.  

  

## What precautions should I take?

Inform your healthcare professional if:

```

## Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus: Tablets 

Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) begins with controlling what you eat. If controlling your diet alone is unable to control your blood sugar levels, then diabetes medications in the form of tablets or injections should be started. 

  

Oral medications for diabetes are used to treat high blood sugar levels caused by T2DM.

  

## Tell Your Doctor if You   

*   Are allergic to any medications  
    
*   Are pregnant or planning to get pregnant 
*   Are breastfeeding​
*   Are taking any other medications 
*   Have any other medical conditions 

## Some Guidelines to Follow When Taking Your Diabetes Tablets

*   Know the name and dosage of your diabetes tablet(s).  
    
*   Take your medication(s) regularly at the correct times and as instructed by your doctor. Do not make any changes to your medication routine without checking with your doctor. 
*   Take your tablet(s) even when you are sick. However, in some cases the dose of your medication may need to be adjusted, so you should see a doctor if you are unwell. 
*   Some medications should not be taken if you are fasting, for example if you are going for a blood test. Please check with your healthcare professional in advance if you should take your medication when you fast. 
*   Follow your meal and exercise plan. A healthy diet and regular exercise are important for good control of diabetes.
*   If you missed a dose of the medication(s), take it as soon as possible. If it is time for your next dose, do not take the missed dose on top of the next dose. You should go back to your regular dosage schedule.
*   Check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking any other medications, including over-the-counter medications.

## Will you become dependent on diabetes medications?

You can never become dependent on medications used to treat diabetes. This is a common misunderstanding among patients who may not like the idea of taking medications for a long period of time.

  

The right way to think about diabetes medications is this: the tablets only work for a specific duration. If you take your diabetes medications only three days of the week instead of every day as instructed, you can expect your blood sugar to be high on the four days that you do not take the medications.

  

Medications used to treat diabetes are meant to help keep you well. However, they will not work if you do not take them.  

  

**​Class of Diabetes Medications**  

**​How it works**  

**​How to take the medication**  

​**What to take note of**  

​Biguanides 

eg. Metformin (Glucophage®)  

​Helps the body to use insulin more effectively and decrease the amount of sugar made by the liver  

​Take the medication tablet(s) with meals or after meals to reduce stomach side effects.  

​The medication may cause:

*   Stomach discomfort
*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Diarrhoea
*   Loss of appetite 
*   Metallic taste in your mouth

This should get better with time after your body gets used to this medication. 

Inform your doctor if you will need an examination involving the injection of a dye or contrast or if you are going for any major surgery. You may need to stop taking this medication for a certain time before and after the examination or the surgery.   

​Sulphonylureas 

eg.

*   Glipizide 
*   Gliclazide (Diamicron®) 
*   Tolbutamide (Rastinon®) 
*   Glimepiride (Amaryl®)
*   Glibenclamide (Daonil®) 
*   Chlorpropamide    
    

​Helps your pancreas to release more insulin  

​Take the medication tablet(s) immediately before meals.

Do not miss or delay meals. Otherwise, your blood sugar level may fall too low.  

  

​This medication may cause weight gain. 

  

Inform your doctor if you have a genetic condition called Glucose-6 Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, a genetic condition in which your red blood cells break down faster than they are made.

  

Alcohol can affect some of these medications. Check with your pharmacist if you are planning to drink alcohol. For example, having alcohol with chlorpropamide increases the risk of side effects like facial flushing and vomiting.  

  

​Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors

eg.   

Linagliptin (Trajenta®) 

Sitagliptin (Januvia®)

Vildagliptin (Galvus®)

Saxagliptin (Onglyza®)  

  

Helps to increase insulin release after a meal and reduce the amount of sugar made by your liver  

​Take the medication before food or after food.  

​Inform your doctor immediately if you have severe stomach pain that does not go away. This could be a sign of the inflammation of the pancreas, a condition known as pancreatitis. 

  

Other symptoms include:

*   Pain, which may spread to your back
*   Nausea and vomiting that does not go away
*   Fever   
    

​Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors

eg. 

Dapagliflozin (Forxiga®) 

Empagliflozin (Jardiance®) 

Canagliflozin (Invokana®)   

  

​Prevent the kidneys from reabsorbing sugar (glucose) back into the blood, hence increasing the amount of sugar that is removed in the urine  

​Take the medication before food or after food.  

​This medication may cause genital and urinary tract infections. This can be prevented by maintaining good genital hygiene.

  

This medication may cause low blood pressure and result in giddiness. You can prevent this by getting up from a sitting or lying position slowly. 

  

Stop the medication and inform your doctor immediately if you experience:

*   Pain in the stomach or abdominal area
*   Nausea or vomiting that does not go away
*   Confusion, tired or unusually sleepy
*   Difficulty breathing
*   Feel very thirsty or have a sweet fruity smell in your breath  
    

​a-glucosidase inhibitors 

eg. Acarbose (Glucobay®)  

​It works by slowing down the breakdown of carbohydrates from our diet to simple sugars. Carbohydrates are a type of nutrient found in starchy foods such as bread, noodles, potatoes and rice. This slows down the absorption of sugar and the quick rise of your blood sugars.  

​Take the medication immediately before or with the first mouthful of food.  

​This medication may cause:

*   Stomach discomfort
*   Bloating or gas
*   Diarrhoea

This should get better with time after your body gets used to this medication.   

  

​Meglitinides 

eg. Repaglinide (Novonorm®)  

Help your pancreas to release more insulin ​

  

  

​Take the medication immediately before meals.

  

Do not miss or delay meals. Otherwise, your blood sugar level may fall too low.  

​

​Thiazolidinediones 

eg. 

\- Pioglitazone (Actos®)

title: Diabetes Treatment - Insulin
url_slug: Diabetes-Treatment-Insulin
keywords: Diabetes Treatment-Insulin,
```

## What is Insulin? 

Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that allows the body to use blood sugar for energy. Carbohydrates, a type of nutrient found in starchy foods such as bread, noodles, potatoes and rice,  are converted into sugar and absorbed into the bloodstream. Insulin allows sugar from the bloodstream to enter the body cells and be used to create energy or be stored for future use. 

People with diabetes are unable to fully use the sugar in their bloodstream either because their bodies do not make enough insulin or the cells do not respond well to insulin, a situation known as insulin resistance. Hence, they would need more insulin to get the same effects.

## Insulin Therapy   

There are two main groups of patients with diabetes and their treatment could be different. 

*   Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) requires the use of insulin and the patient needs to control their diet.
*   Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients may be treated with oral medications and need to control their diet. In some T2DM patients, they may also require insulin injections.

Insulin is injected into the fatty tissue that is between the skin and muscle layer.

**Starting on insulin when already on oral tablets for T2DM patients**

T2DM is a progressive illness. This means that what you did at the beginning to control your condition through your diet, exercise or medications may change over time.  

   

As your diabetes progresses, the management of your condition can change from diet and exercise alone, to adding oral diabetes medications. Patients who have had diabetes for a long time may naturally find that they progress to a combination of oral diabetes medications and insulin. 

Some T2DM patients might feel that once they have started insulin, it could mean that their condition is now very serious or they have “failed” in controlling their diabetes. However, it is important to understand that this is a natural progression of the disease. If your diabetes is not controlled, it can lead to serious health complications such as an increased risk of heart disease and eye or kidney problems.

If you are on insulin, you should know how to:

 • Measure out your insulin doses

 • Inject insulin yourself (and not rely on others) as far as possible

 • Adjust your diet and activity to your insulin injections

## Types of Insulin    

There are several types of insulin. They differ mainly in how quickly they start to lower blood sugar once injected, and how long their effects last in the body.  

​**Type**   

**​When to take it**   

**​When the medication starts working after you have injected it**  

​**How long does the medication effect last after you have injected it**  

​**Rapid-acting** 

*   Apidra® 
*   Novorapid® 
*   Humalog® 

​Immediately before a meal   

​10-20 minutes  

​2-4 hours  

**​Short-acting** 

*   Actrapid® HM
*   Humulin® R     
    

​30 minutes before a meal   

​30 minutes   

6-8 hours ​

​**Intermediate-acting** 

*   Humulin® N 
*   Insulatard® HM 

​Before breakfast and/or at bedtime  

​1-3 hours   

​16-24 hours   

**​Long-acting** 

*   Levemir® 
*   Lantus® 
*   Toujeo® 
*   Tresiba® 
*   Soliqua® \*  
    

​Daily at the same time (eg. bedtime)  

​3-4 hours  

​Variable. 

Up to 24 hours for Levemir®, Lantus® and Soliqua®.

May last more than 24h for Toujeo® and Tresiba®.  

  

​**Pre-mixed** 

  

These are mixtures of rapid/ short-acting and intermediate/ long-acting insulins

*   Humalog® Mix 
*   Novomix® 30 
*   Mixtard® 30 
*   Humulin® 30/70
*   Ryzodeg®

​Variable, inject before meals. Refer to your medication label for timing of injection for your specific type of pre-mixed insulin   

​Variable  

​Variable, 14 to more than 24 hours   

Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) is more likely to occur around the time of maximum action. High blood sugar (hyperglycemia) is more likely to occur before the insulin starts acting or when its action is ending.   

  

\* Soliqua® is a combination of long-acting insulin and lixisenatide (another type of diabetes medication class known as GLP1 agonist)  

  

## How to Inject Insulin    

Knowing where to inject your insulin will make the injection easier, safer and more comfortable. Insulin is injected into the fatty tissue that is between the skin and muscle layer. After insulin is injected, it is absorbed into the blood and is used by your body.

There are three main areas of injection:

 • Abdomen — insulin is absorbed fastest here into the blood 

 • Arm

 • Thigh and buttocks — insulin is absorbed slowest here into the blood 

Your doctor or nurse will advise you on the best area to inject. You should keep to the same injection area (abdomen OR arm OR thigh/buttock) to ensure consistent insulin absorption.

You should rotate the injection site within the same area to prevent your body from forming lipodystrophy (a small lump or dent in the skin that forms when a person repeatedly injects in the same spot). 

*   Insulin injected into these hardened areas may not be absorbed well. 
*   Check your injection areas every few days by pressing gently and running your fingertips across the skin. 
*   Inform your healthcare professionals if there are any lumps, painful spots or change in colour anywhere.
*   Avoid using these areas until they have recovered.

If you are injecting into the abdomen area, inject at least two inches away from the belly button and avoid areas with scars or bruises. 

   

You may refer to [this article](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/Insulin-Injection-Technique) for more details on insulin injection techniques.   

   

## Handling and storage   

Unopened insulin should be stored in the refrigerator (not in the freezer). Frozen insulin cannot be used. You should always keep at least one extra vial or pen of each type of insulin. 

Once opened, the insulin vial or pen should be stored at room temperature and away from direct sunlight. The opened insulin vial or pen can be kept for four to six weeks depending on the type of insulin you use. Refer to your medication label to check how long you can keep your insulin for.

When you are travelling, carry your insulin and syringes with you. Do not put the insulin in your check-in luggage or in your car boot.

Discard the insulin if

*   It has expired  
    
*   Your insulin has changed colour
*   You are using a clear insulin and you find particles in it. Examples of clear insulins are Apidra, Novorapid, Actrapid and Glargine. 
*   You are using a cloudy insulin and you see white substances that remain at the bottom of the container after mixing even after you roll the vial or pen thoroughly.  Examples of cloudy insulins are Mixtard and Novomix.

## Insulin Devices 

**Syringes** 

Syringes are used to deliver the correct and accurate insulin doses to patients. Choose a suitable syringe that best matches the number of units required.

A 0.3mL syringe should be used for doses up to 30 units. A 0.5mL syringe should be used for doses up to 50 units. A 1mL syringe can be used for doses up to 100 units. 

Do not reuse insulin syringes. Throw away the syringe after every injection.   

**Insulin Pens**

Insulin pens combine both the insulin cartridge and measuring dial into one device. Some insulin pens are disposable whereas some are reusable. Thus, insulin injections become more convenient as you do not have to carry syringes and insulin vials separately with you. 

**Insulin Pumps**

The insulin pump is a small computerised device that pumps insulin continuously through a fine plastic tube into a site under the skin throughout the day.   

Pump users have to monitor their blood sugar frequently so as to make adjustments to the amount of insulin delivered. The insulin pump generally gives you better control and more meal flexibility but is more expensive and requires more frequent blood sugar monitoring.

## Side Effects    

The most common side effect with the use of insulin is low blood sugar. If you inject insulin but do not eat on time, your blood sugar may become too low. Low blood sugar levels might also happen if you do not eat well or if you drink alcohol on an empty stomach while on insulin therapy.

  

Symptoms of low blood sugar include:

*   Weakness
*   Dizziness
*   Hunger
*   Sweating
*   Trembling 
*   Blurred vision
*   Walking unsteadily 
*   Fast heartbeat

If you experience any of these low blood sugar symptoms, do the following immediately:   

  

Step 1: Check your blood sugar level with a home blood sugar meter (glucometer) if available. If your blood sugar level is less than 4 mmol/L, take 15 grams of fast-acting sugar such as:

*   3 glucose tablets or 
*   Half a glass of fruit juice (200ml) or
*   1 can of less sugar soft drink (330ml) or
*   3 teaspoons of sugar, honey or syrup

  

Step 2: Monitor yourself for 15 minutes. If you have a glucometer (home blood sugar meter), check your blood sugar level again after 15 minutes. 

  

Step 3: If your blood sugar level is still less than 4 mmol/L or you still have symptoms of low blood sugar, you should take another 15 grams of fast-acting sugar as per Step 1.

  

If your symptoms do not go away, see a doctor or go to the hospital immediately.

Step 4: Take your meal or snack if your blood sugar level is 4 mmol/L and above after consuming the fast-acting sugar earlier on. 

Inform your doctor about this during the next visit.  

**Other side effects include:** 

*   Some patients may also experience mild pain, redness, bruising, swelling, a small lump or dent of the skin at the injection site.

*   Do not reuse your needles, rotate injection sites within the recommended areas and use shorter needles (4mm or 6mm) to reduce the chances of developing such reactions. 
*   They also usually go away in a few days to a few weeks. 
*   See a doctor if you frequently experience this. Your injection technique may need to be reviewed.    
    

*   Rashes on the injection site or, in rare cases, all over the body

## What is this medication for?

Madopar contains two medications: Levodopa and Benserazide.

This medication is used in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disorder of the nervous system that affects movement. This medication helps to improve muscle control and allows more normal body movements.

Levodopa is converted into a chemical called “dopamine” in the brain which helps to improve the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Benserazide helps Levodopa to work more effectively by slowing down the speed at which Levodopa is broken down in the body.

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   Do not stop taking Madopar without checking with your healthcare professional.
    
*   You may take Madopar on an empty stomach. However, it may be taken with low-protein food if your stomach becomes irritated.

title: Insulin (Human) (Neutral)
url_slug: Insulin-Human-Neutral
keywords: Insulin (Human) (Neutral),Insulin (Human) (Regular),Insulin (Human) (Soluble),ACTRAPID,
```

## What is this medication for?

Insulin (Human) (Neutral) or Soluble Insulin is a short-acting insulin. It is used to control blood sugar levels after each meal.

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

Soluble Insulin is given 30 minutes before a meal as an injection under the skin into the fatty tissue that is between the skin and muscle layer.   

  

Do not forget to eat after injecting Soluble Insulin.   

  

Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse and as described in the manual.   

  

Ensure that your insulin appears clear and colourless before use. Do not use it if it appears cloudy, grainy or if particles are seen in the vial.   

  

Do not stop insulin without checking with your doctor.

  

  

How to select an injection site

Insulin should be injected into the fatty tissue that is between the skin and muscle layer. You should rotate the injection site within the same area to prevent your body from forming lipodystrophy (a small lump or dent in the skin that forms when a person repeatedly injects in the same spot).   

  

Do not inject insulin in the areas that are actively used during exercise.

   

Your abdomen or stomach area is the best site for injection as it provides the fastest and most consistent absorption of insulin. 

  

  

How to inject insulin

1.  Clean the skin before injecting the insulin. 
2.  Lift a skin fold.
3.  Insert the needle at 90 degrees, at a right angle to the skin. 
4.  During the injection, inject the insulin by pushing the plunger all the way down slowly with your index finger.

*   If you are using an insulin pen, hold the needle and pen in place for 10 seconds before removing the needle and releasing the pinched skin
*   If you are using the insulin vial and syringe, there is no need to hold the needle in place for 10 seconds

6.  While removing the needle from your skin, make sure you keep the plunger pushed down. This will ensure you get the full dose. Do not rub or massage the injection site. 
7.  Throw the syringe or pen needle away properly in a container that cannot be punctured.

  

You may refer to [this article](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/Insulin-Injection-Technique) for more details on insulin injection techniques.   

  

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

If you missed a dose, inject the next dose at the usual time.   

  

Do not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.   

  

If you forget to inject your insulin, your blood sugar may get too high, a condition known as hyperglycemia. Check your blood sugar with a home blood sugar meter (glucometer).

If your blood sugar remains high for too long, you might develop diabetic ketoacidosis. This is a complication of diabetes that is caused by an increase in the amount of ketones in your blood or urine, which causes your blood to become more acidic. Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include:  

*   Increased urination  
    
*   Feeling thirsty
*   Feeling sick, nauseous or vomiting
*   Feeling drowsy or tired
*   Having abdominal pain
*   Having a flushed face 
*   Sweet fruity smell in your breath

You should see the doctor immediately if you have the above symptoms.

  

## What precautions should I take?

Inform your healthcare professional if you:

*   Are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication
*   Drink alcohol often
*   Are eating less than usual due to sickness/a changed diet as your dosage may need to be changed
*   Are travelling across different time zones. You might need to adjust the number of meals and the dose of your insulin based on where you travel to 
*   Are pregnant or breastfeeding

  

If your doctor has informed you that you need to do a fasting blood test, do not inject insulin until after you have your blood taken and are ready to eat. 

  

## What are some common side effects of this medication?

Like all medications, this medication may cause some possible side effects but not everyone experiences them. Consult your healthcare professional if any of the side effects becomes severe and bothersome.

  

This medication may cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Symptoms of low blood sugar include:

*   Weakness 
*   Dizziness 
*   Hunger 
*   Sweating   
    
*   Trembling 
*   Blurred vision 
*   Walking unsteadily 
*   Fast heartbeat 

  

If you experience any of these low blood sugar symptoms, do the following immediately: 

> Step 1: Check your blood sugar level with a home blood sugar meter (glucometer) if available. If your blood sugar level is less than 4 mmol/L, take 15 grams of fast-acting sugar. Examples of 15 grams of fast-acting sugar include：

*   3 glucose tablets or 
*   Half a glass of fruit juice (200ml) or
*   Half a can of soft drink or sweetened drink (175ml) or
*   1 can of less sugar soft drink (330ml) or
*   3 teaspoons of sugar, honey or syrup

> Step 2: Monitor yourself for 15 minutes. If you have a glucometer (home blood sugar meter), check your blood sugar level again after 15 minutes. 

>   
> 
> Step 3: If your blood sugar level is still less than 4 mmol/L or you still have symptoms of low blood sugar, you should take another 15 grams of fast-acting sugar as per Step 1.

>   
> 
> If your symptoms do not go away, see a doctor or go to the hospital immediately.

>   
> 
> Step 4: Take your meal or snack if your blood sugar level is 4 mmol/L and above after consuming the fast-acting sugar earlier on. 

  

Low blood sugar may occur if you: 

*   Inject too much insulin
*   Do not eat on time, miss your meals or change your diet
*   Exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal
*   Do not eat well due to an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting)
*   Drink alcohol on an empty stomach while injecting insulin
*   Have kidney or liver problems which have worsened

Some patients may also experience mild pain, redness, bruising, swelling, a small lump or dent of the skin at the injection site.

*   Do not reuse your needles, rotate injection sites within the recommended areas and use shorter needles (4mm or 6mm) to reduce the chances of developing such reactions. 
*   They also usually go away in a few days to a few weeks. 
*   See a doctor if you frequently experience this. Your injection technique may need to be reviewed. 

  

## What are some rare but serious side effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?

See a doctor or go to the hospital immediately if your blood sugar level is always low (less than 4 mmol/L) or you continue to experience symptoms of low blood sugar even after taking some sugar (see instructions above for management of low blood sugar).

  

## What food or medication should I avoid when I take/use this medication?  

Avoid taking alcohol with this medication as this may increase your risk of having low blood sugar. 

  

## How should I store this medication?

Store all unopened insulin in a refrigerator between 2 to 8 degrees Celsius. **Do not freeze**.

## What is Insulin? 

Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that allows the body to use blood sugar for energy. Carbohydrates, a type of nutrient found in starchy foods such as bread, noodles, potatoes and rice, are converted into sugar and absorbed into the bloodstream. Insulin allows sugar from the bloodstream to enter the body cells and be used to create energy or be stored for future use. 

People with diabetes are unable to fully use the sugar in their bloodstream either because their bodies do not make enough insulin or the cells do not respond well to insulin, a situation known as insulin resistance. Hence, they would need more insulin to get the same effects.

  

## Insulin Devices 

**Syringes** 

Syringes are used to deliver the correct and accurate insulin doses to patients. Choose a suitable syringe that best matches the number of units required.

A 0.3mL syringe should be used for doses up to 30 units. A 0.5mL syringe should be used for doses up to 50 units. A 1mL syringe can be used for doses up to 100 units. 

Do not reuse insulin syringes. Throw away the syringe after every injection.   

**Insulin Pens**

Insulin pens combine both the insulin cartridge and measuring dial into one device. Some insulin pens are disposable whereas some are reusable. Thus, insulin injections become more convenient as you do not have to carry syringes and insulin vials separately with you. 

**Insulin Pumps**

The insulin pump is a small computerised device that pumps insulin continuously through a fine plastic tube into a site under the skin throughout the day. 

Pump users have to monitor their blood sugar frequently so as to make adjustments to the amount of insulin delivered. The insulin pump generally gives you better control and more meal flexibility but is more expensive  and requires more frequent blood sugar monitoring.

  

## How to Inject Insulin  

Knowing where to inject your insulin will make the injection easier, safer and more comfortable. Insulin is injected into the fatty tissue that is between the skin and muscle layer. After insulin is injected, it is absorbed into the blood and is used by your body.

There are three main areas of injection:

 • Abdomen — insulin is absorbed fastest here into the blood

 • Arm 

 • Thigh and buttocks — insulin is absorbed slowest here into the blood 

Your doctor or nurse will advise you on the best area to inject. You should keep to the same injection area (abdomen OR arm OR thigh/buttock) to ensure consistent insulin absorption. 

You should rotate the injection site within the same area to prevent your body from forming lipodystrophy (a small lump or dent in the skin that forms when a person repeatedly injects in the same spot). 

*   Insulin injected into these hardened areas may not be absorbed well. 
*   Check your injection areas every few days by pressing gently and running your fingertips across the skin. 
*   Inform your healthcare professionals if there are any lumps, painful spots or change in colour anywhere. 
*   Avoid using these areas until they have recovered.   
    

If you are injecting into the abdomen area, inject at least two inches away (two fingers) from the belly button and avoid areas with scars or bruises.

**B. Insulin pen** 

How to prepare your insulin pen for injection   

  

​1.  

​Wash and dry your hands.  

​![](https://ch-api.healthhub.sg/api/public/content/3185459d9f4c4542aabef3e724dfc839?v=2b0e3406)  

​2.  

​Only for **cloudy** insulin (Skip to step 3 if you are using a **clear** insulin): 

  

Roll the insulin pen gently between the palms of your hands. This mixes the insulin and warms it to body temperature to reduce the pain when you inject.

  

Move the pen up and down gently so that the glass ball moves from one end of the cartridge to the other. 

  

Repeat rolling and moving the pen until the liquid appears uniformly white and cloudy.   

​  

​3.  

​Clean the rubber membrane on the insulin pen with an alcohol swab. Allow it to dry and attach the pen needle onto the insulin pen. Do not remove the outer and inner cap from the new pen needle while attaching the pen needle.   
​

​4.  

​Remove the outer and inner cap of the needle.  
​

​5.  

​Dial 2 units by turning the dose selector.  
​

​6.  

​Hold the insulin pen with the needle upwards and tap the cartridge gently with your finger a few times to let air bubbles collect at the top of the cartridge.   
​

​7.  

​With the insulin pen still pointing upwards, press the push button all the way in. 

  

The dose selector should return to ‘0’ and a drop of insulin should appear at the needle tip. 

If no insulin comes out: 

*   Check for air bubbles and repeat the above step two more times to remove them.
*   If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again.
*   If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your insulin pen may be damaged. Use a new insulin pen.   
    

​

​8.  

​Select the dose of insulin you need.   

  

  

How to inject insulin with an insulin pen  

​1.  

​Select an injection site to inject and clean the area with an alcohol swab. Wait for the alcohol to dry before moving to step 2.

Ibuprofen, which is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is used for the relief of headache, menstrual pain, backache, muscular and arthritic pain, toothache and the aches of cold and flu and reduction of fever. Ibuprofen works by changing the body's response to high temperature, reducing pain and swelling.

## Ibuprofen Dosage and How to Use

### Adults and adolescents 12 years old and above

The recommended Ibuprofen dose is 400mg (two tablets) to be taken initially. 200mg (one tablet) to 400mg (two tablets) may be taken every 4 hours when required. Do not take more than 1200mg (6 tablets) in a day. Take with or after food.

title: Insulin (Human) (Isophane)
url_slug: Insulin-Human-Isophane
keywords: Insulin (Human) Isophane,INSULATARD,NPH,
```

## What is this medication for?

Isophane insulin is an intermediate-acting insulin. It is used to reduce high blood sugar levels in patients with diabetes. 

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

Use Isophane insulin as instructed by your doctor as an injection into the fatty tissue that is between the skin and muscle layer. Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse and as described in the manual.   

  

After mixing, Isophane insulin should look like milk or look cloudy. If you see any white substance that remains at the bottom of the container after mixing, you should not use it.

  

For Isophane insulin penfill, always check that there are at least 12 units of insulin left in the cartridge (penfill) to allow resuspension. If there are less than 12 units left, please use a new insulin cartridge (penfill).

  

  

How to select an injection site

Insulin should be injected into the fatty tissue that is between the skin and muscle layer. You should rotate the injection site within the same area to prevent your body from forming lipodystrophy (a small lump or dent in the skin that forms when a person repeatedly injects in the same spot).   

  

Do not inject insulin in the areas that are actively used during exercise. 

  

Your abdomen or stomach area is the best site for injection as it provides the fastest and most consistent absorption of insulin. 

  

  

How to inject insulin

1.  Clean the skin before injecting the insulin. 
2.  Lift a skin fold.
3.  Insert the needle at 90 degrees, at a right angle to the skin. 
4.  During the injection, inject the insulin by pushing the plunger all the way down slowly with your index finger

*   If you are using an insulin pen, hold the needle and pen in place for 10 seconds before removing the needle and releasing the pinched skin
*   If you are using the insulin vial and syringe, there is no need to hold the needle in place for 10 seconds

6.  While removing the needle from your skin, make sure you keep the plunger pushed down. This will ensure you get the full dose. Do not rub or massage the injection site. 
7.  Throw the syringe or pen needle away properly in a container that cannot be punctured.  
    

  

You may refer to [this article](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/Insulin-Injection-Technique) for more details on insulin injection techniques.   

  

  

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

If you missed a dose, discuss with your doctor on what to do next.   

  

If you forget to inject your insulin, your blood sugar may get too high, a condition known as hyperglycemia. Check your blood sugar with a home blood sugar meter (glucometer).   

  

If your blood sugar remains high for too long, you might develop diabetic ketoacidosis. This is a complication of diabetes that is caused by an increase in the amount of ketones in your blood or urine, which causes your blood to become more acidic. Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include

*   Increased urination
*   Feeling thirsty  
    
*   Feeling sick, nauseous or vomiting
*   Feeling drowsy or tired
*   Having abdominal pain
*   Having a flushed face 
*   Sweet fruity smell in your breath

You should see the doctor immediately if you have the above symptoms.

  

## What precautions should I take?

Inform your healthcare professional if you:

*   Are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication
*   Drink alcohol often
*   Are eating less than usual due to sickness/a changed diet as your dosage may need to be changed
*   Are travelling across different time zones. You might need to adjust the number of meals and the dose of your insulin depending on where you travel to. 
*   Are pregnant or breastfeeding

  

Discuss with your doctor if you should omit this insulin injection until after your blood test is taken.

  

## What are some common side effects of this medication?

Like all medications, this medication may cause some possible side effects but not everyone experiences them. Consult your healthcare professional if any of the side effects becomes severe and bothersome.

  

This medication may cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Symptoms of low blood sugar include:

*   Weakness 
*   Dizziness 
*   Hunger 
*   Sweating 
*   Trembling 
*   Blurred vision 
*   Walking unsteadily 
*   Fast heartbeat 

  

If you experience any of these low blood sugar symptoms, do the following immediately: 

> Step 1: Check your blood sugar level with a home blood sugar meter (glucometer) if available. If your blood sugar level is less than 4 mmol/L, take 15 grams of fast-acting sugar. Examples of 15 grams of fast-acting sugar include:
> 
> *   3 glucose tablets or 
> *   Half a glass of fruit juice (200ml) or
> *   Half a can of soft drink or sweetened drink (175ml) or
> *   1 can of less sugar soft drink (330ml) or
> *   3 teaspoons of sugar, honey or syrup
> 
>   
> 
> Step 2: Monitor yourself for 15 minutes. If you have a glucometer (home blood sugar meter), check your blood sugar level again after 15 minutes. 
> 
>   
> 
> Step 3: If your blood sugar level is still less than 4 mmol/L or you still have symptoms of low blood sugar, you should take another 15 grams of fast-acting sugar as per Step 1.
> 
>   
> 
> If your symptoms do not go away, see a doctor or go to the hospital immediately.  
> 
>   
> 
> Step 4: Take your meal or snack if your blood sugar level is 4 mmol/L and above after consuming the fast-acting sugar earlier on. 

  

Low blood sugar may occur if you: 

*   Inject too much insulin
*   Do not eat on time, miss your meals or change your diet
*   Exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal
*   Do not eat well due to an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting)
*   Drink alcohol on an empty stomach while injecting insulin
*   Have kidney or liver problems which have worsened

  

Some patients may also experience mild pain, redness, bruising, swelling or a small lump or dent of the skin at the injection site.  

*   Do not reuse your needles, rotate injection sites within the recommended areas and use shorter needles (4mm or 6mm) to reduce the chances of developing such reactions.   
    
*   They also usually go away in a few days to a few weeks. 
*   See a doctor if you frequently experience this. Your injection technique may need to be reviewed. 

  

## What are some rare but serious side effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?

See a doctor or go to the hospital immediately if your blood sugar level is always low (less than 4 mmol/L) or you continue to experience symptoms of low blood sugar even after taking some sugar (see instructions above for management of low blood sugar).

  

## What food or medication should I avoid when I take/use this medication?

Avoid taking alcohol with this medication as this may increase your risk of having low blood sugar.   

  

## How should I store this medication?

Store all unopened insulin in a refrigerator between 2 to 8 degrees Celsius. **Do not freeze**.   

  

Do not keep insulin in a hot place (eg. in a hot, closed vehicle, on top of a television set) or expose it to heat or sunlight. Do not use the insulin if this happens.   

  

Once the insulin has been first used, do not refrigerate, but keep it in a cool dry place.

## What is this medication for?

Ixekizumab is a biologic medication which works by blocking the activity of a protein called interleukin (IL) 17A.

IL-17A levels are increased in diseases such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. This medication helps to reduce the activity of the immune system and the symptoms of the diseases.

Ixekizumab does not work immediately and it may take several weeks before you notice any improvement in symptoms.

## How should I take/use this medication?

Ixekizumab should be used as prescribed and you should not stop using the medication without discussing it with your doctor. Stopping Ixekizumab suddenly may cause the symptoms of your condition to return.

It may be taken alone, with methotrexate, or with other disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).

Ixekizumab is available in a solution for injection that comes in a pre-filled form (ready-to-use). It is given via injection under the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach, thigh or upper outer arm. You and your doctor will decide if you should administer Ixekizumab yourself. You or your carer should receive training on how to inject the medication from your doctor, pharmacist or specialty nurse before attempting the administration on your own. Always remember to rotate the injection site with each injection.

Your doctor will decide how much Ixekizumab you need and for how long it has to be taken.

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

If you miss a dose, inject it as soon as you remember. Talk to your doctor to discuss when the next dose should be given.

title: Insulin Lispro 
url_slug: Insulin-Lispro
keywords: insulin lispro,HUMALOG,
```

## What is this medication for?  

Insulin Lispro is a rapid (fast) acting insulin. It is used to control blood sugar levels after each meal.   

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

Insulin Lispro is given immediately or 15 minutes before a meal as an injection into the fatty tissue that is between the skin and muscle layer.   

  

Do not forget to eat after injecting Insulin Lispro. If you need to, you can inject immediately after a meal instead.   

  

Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or nurse and as described in the manual.   

  

Ensure that your insulin appears clear and colourless before use. Do not use it if it appears cloudy, grainy or if particles are seen in the penfill or vial. 

   

Do not stop insulin without checking with your doctor.  

  

  

How to select an injection site

Insulin should be injected into the fatty tissue that is between the skin and muscle layer. You should rotate the injection site within the same area to prevent your body from forming lipodystrophy (a small lump or dent in the skin that forms when a person repeatedly injects in the same spot).   

  

Do not inject insulin in the areas that are actively used during exercise.   

  

Your abdomen or stomach area is the best site for injection as it provides the fastest and most consistent absorption of insulin. 

  

  

How to inject insulin  

1.  Clean the skin before injecting the insulin. 
2.  Lift a skin fold.
3.  Insert the needle at 90 degrees, at a right angle to the skin. 
4.  During the injection, inject the insulin by pushing the plunger all the way down slowly with your index finger

*   If you are using an insulin pen, hold the needle and pen in place for 10 seconds before removing the needle and releasing the pinched skin
*   If you are using the insulin vial and syringe, there is no need to hold the needle in place for 10 seconds. 

6.  While removing the needle from your skin, make sure you keep the plunger pushed down. This will ensure you get the full dose. Do not rub or massage the injection site. 
7.  Throw the syringe or pen needle away properly in a container that cannot be punctured.  
    

  

You may refer to [this article](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/Insulin-Injection-Technique) for more details on insulin injection techniques.  

  

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?  

If you missed a dose before your meal, it can be given immediately after your meal.

   

If you forget to inject your insulin, your blood sugar may get too high, a condition known as hyperglycemia. Check your blood sugar with a home blood sugar meter (glucometer).   

  

If your blood sugar remains high for too long, you might develop diabetic ketoacidosis. This is a complication of diabetes that is caused by an increase in the amount of ketones in your blood or urine, which causes your blood to become more acidic. Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include:  

*   Increased urination
*   Feeling thirsty  
    
*   Feeling sick, nauseous or vomiting
*   Feeling drowsy or tired
*   Having abdominal pain
*   Having a flushed face 
*   Sweet fruity smell in your breath

You should see the doctor immediately if you have the above symptoms. 

  

## What precautions should I take?

Inform your healthcare professional if you:

*   Are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication
*   Drink alcohol often
*   Are eating less than usual due to sickness/a changed diet as your dosage may need to be changed
*   Are travelling across different time zones. You might need to adjust the number of meals and the dose of your insulin based on where you travel to.
*   Are pregnant or breastfeeding

  

If your doctor has informed you that you need to do a fasting blood test, do not inject insulin until after you have your blood taken and are ready to eat.

  

## What are some common side effects of this medication?

Like all medications, this medication may cause some possible side effects but not everyone experiences them. Consult your healthcare professional if any of the side effects becomes severe and bothersome.

  

This medication may cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Symptoms of low blood sugar include:

*   Weakness 
*   Dizziness 
*   Hunger 
*   Sweating 
*   Trembling 
*   Blurred vision   
    
*   Walking unsteadily 
*   Fast heartbeat 

  

If you experience any of these low blood sugar symptoms, do the following immediately: 

Step 1: Check your blood sugar level with a home blood sugar meter (glucometer) if available. If your blood sugar level is less than 4 mmol/L, take 15 grams of fast-acting sugar. Examples of 15 grams of fast-acting sugar include:

*   3 glucose tablets or 
*   Half a glass of fruit juice (200ml) or
*   Half a can of soft drink or  sweetened drink (175ml) or
*   1 can of less sugar soft drink (330ml) or
*   3 teaspoons of sugar, honey or syrup

  

Step 2: Monitor yourself for 15 minutes. If you have a glucometer (home blood sugar meter), check your blood sugar level again after 15 minutes. 

  

Step 3: If your blood sugar level is still less than 4 mmol/L or you still have symptoms of low blood sugar, you should take another 15 grams of fast-acting sugar as per Step 1.

  

If your symptoms do not go away, see a doctor or go to the hospital immediately.

  

Step 4: Take your meal or snack if your blood sugar level is 4 mmol/L and above after consuming the fast-acting sugar earlier on. 

  

Low blood sugar may occur if you: 

*   Inject too much insulin
*   Do not eat on time, miss your meals or change your diet
*   Exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal
*   Do not eat well due to an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting)
*   Drink alcohol on an empty stomach while injecting insulin
*   Have kidney or liver problems which have worsened

  

Some patients may also experience mild pain, redness, bruising, swelling, a small lump or dent of the skin at the injection site.

*   Do not reuse your needles, rotate injection sites within the recommended areas and use shorter needles (4mm or 6mm) to reduce the chances of developing such reactions. 
*   They also usually go away in a few days to a few weeks. 
*   See a doctor if you frequently experience this. Your injection technique may need to be reviewed. 

  

## What are some rare but serious side effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?

See a doctor or go to the hospital immediately if your blood sugar level is always low (less than 4 mmol/L) or you continue to experience symptoms of low blood sugar even after taking some sugar (see instructions above for management of low blood sugar).

  

## What food or medication should I avoid when I take/use this medication?

Avoid taking alcohol with this medication as this may increase your risk of having low blood sugar.

  

## How should I store this medication?  

Store all unopened insulin in a refrigerator between 2 to 8 degrees Celsius. **Do not freeze.**

Do not keep insulin in a hot place (eg. in a hot, closed vehicle, on top of a television set) or expose it to heat or sunlight. Insulin that is exposed to direct sunlight for too long may give it a yellow-brown color. Do not use the insulin if this happens. 

  

Once the insulin has been first used, do not refrigerate, but keep it in a cool dry place. Discard the insulin 4 weeks after opening. 

  

Keep this medication out of reach of children. Throw away all expired medication.

  

  

## How do I handle this medication safely?  

Please refer to the product insert which can be found in the medication box, for instructions for use of your specific insulin pen/penfill/vials. Insulin penfills are designed to be used with compatible Eli Lilly branded insulin pens. Please check with your pharmacist if you are unsure.

## What is this medication for?

PAXLOVID is an antiviral medication which may be used for treatment of mild-moderate COVID-19 in adults and children (12 years of age and older, and weighing at least 40 kilograms) who are at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID-19. It should be administered within 5 days of symptom onset.   

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

The usual dosage is 300 mg Nirmatrelvir (two 150 mg, pink-coloured tablets) and 100 mg Ritonavir (one 100 mg, white-coloured tablet). Take all three tablets together twice daily for 5 days, with or without food. Complete this 5-day course even if you feel better.  

  

**If you have kidney disease, and are considered by your doctor to be suitable for PAXLOVID, you may need a lower dosage** (one 150 mg pink coloured tablet of Nirmatrelvir, with one 100 mg white-coloured tablet of Ritonavir, twice daily for 5 days).  

  

PAXLOVID should not be used for longer than 5 consecutive days because the safety and efficacy of use for longer than 5 consecutive days have not been established.  

  

If you do not feel better, or if you feel worse during or after the course of 5 days, you should see your doctor.  

  

PAXLOVID tablets may be split or crushed for administration via a feeding tube or mixed with food or liquid, if necessary. Any suspension or preparation made with crushed PAXLOVID should be consumed/administered immediately.  

  

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

If you miss a dose within 8 hours of the time it is usually taken, take it as soon as possible and take your next dose at the usual time.  

  

If you miss a dose by more than 8 hours, skip the dose and take your next dose at the usual time. Do not take double doses to make up for the missed dose.

## What is this medication for?

It is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for patients who cannot tolerate or do not respond to conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). It is also used to treat lupus nephritis, an inflammation of the kidney that is caused by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

In rheumatoid arthritis, Tacrolimus suppresses your immune system and prevents it from attacking your joints and causing inflammation. This helps to reduce symptoms of joint swelling, pain and stiffness. In the long term, it also reduces joint deformity and bone erosion from the inflammatory condition.

In lupus nephritis, Tacrolimus suppresses your immune system and prevents it from attacking your kidney. This helps to reduce kidney damage and leakage of proteins in your urine (proteinuria).

This medication may also be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.

keywords: Tetanus vaccine,tetanus toxoid,Tetavax,
```

## What the Tetanus Vaccine Used for?

Tetanus vaccines help to prevent tetanus from recent cuts or wounds that have been contaminated with the bacteria, _Clostridium tetani_. Some examples of tetanus-prone wounds include those contaminated with dirt, faeces, soil and saliva, or a puncture wound (e.g. due to an animal bite).

Tetanus is a serious disease affecting the nerves. The tetanus bacteria produces a toxin that causes “lockjaw”, resulting in painful muscle contractions. This affects breathing and swallowing and can lead to death.

## Who Should Receive the Tetanus Vaccine?

As part of post-exposure prevention of tetanus, the recommendations are summarized below:

​**Type of Wound**  

**​Person Not/Partially Vaccinated Against Tetanus or Vaccination Status Unknown**  

​**Person Completely Vaccinated Against Tetanus**

  

**(Time Since Last Booster)**

**​5 to 10 years**  

**​More than 10 years**  

​Minor: Clean  

​1 dose of Tetanus vaccine  

​No need for Tetanus vaccine  

​1 dose of Tetanus vaccine  

​Major: Clean or Tetanus-prone  

​1 dose of Tetanus vaccine\*  

​1 dose of Tetanus vaccine  

​1 dose of Tetanus vaccine\*  

  

\*Please consult your doctor for more advice on the number of doses required to complete the vaccination series.

You may also consider receiving the tetanus vaccine, if you have not had the vaccine in the last 10 years, and are going to remote areas where medical care is not easily accessible.

## What Precautions Should I Follow Before Receiving the Tetanus Vaccine?

url_slug: Alirocumab
keywords: Alirocumab,Praluent,
```

## ​What is this medication for?

Alirocumab is a type of monoclonal antibody (a man-made protein that attaches to a target in the body) that increases the liver’s ability to remove bad cholesterol. This lowers the amount of ‘bad cholesterol’ in the blood.  

  

High ‘bad cholesterol’ levels can cause blood vessels to clog up and lead to chest pain (angina), heart attack or stroke. By reducing the amount of bad cholesterol in the body, this medication reduces the risk of future heart attack and stroke. 

  

This medication may also be used for patients with high ‘bad cholesterol’ levels in their blood because of a hereditary condition (a medical condition that runs in the family).

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.
*   You may use this medication with or without food. 
*   Use the injection pen as advised by your healthcare professional and as described in the manual.   
    

Before using the pre-filled injection pen,  

*   Do not use the pre-filled pen if it has been frozen or is frozen.
*   Do not use the pre-filled pen if it has been dropped on a hard surface. Part of the pre-filled pen may be broken even if you cannot see the breakage.
*   Ensure that the contents of your pre-filled pen appear clear and colourless to slightly yellow before use. Do not use it if it appears cloudy, discoloured, grainy or if particles are seen.
*   Do not shake the pre-filled pen.  
    
*   Wait at least 30 minutes for the pre-filled pen to naturally reach room temperature before injecting. Do not warm the pre-filled pen by using a heat source such as hot water or microwave.
*   Do not remove the blue cap from the pre-filled pen until you are ready to inject.  
    

Using the pre-filled injector pen,  

*   Select and clean your injection site. Always rotate the injection site. Injection sites that can be used include:

*   Thigh
*   Stomach area (abdomen), except for a 5 centimetre area around your belly button
*   Outer area of upper arm (only if someone else is giving you the injection)

*   Pull the blue cap straight off, only when you are ready to inject. Do not leave the blue cap off for more than 5 minutes. This can dry out the medication.

title: Glyceryl Trinitrate
url_slug: Glyceryl-Trinitrate
keywords: GTN,Glyceryl Trinitrate,
```

## What is this medication for?  

Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) belongs to a class of medications called Nitrates. Nitrates are used to prevent and treat the symptoms of angina (chest pain). Angina is caused by lack of blood supply and oxygen to your heart. Nitrates work by relaxing blood vessels so that more blood and oxygen is supplied to the heart.  

  

Nitrates are used to treat angina in three ways:

*   To relieve an ongoing attack by using the medication at the start of the attack.
*   To prevent attacks from occurring by using the medication just before an attack is expected to occur.
*   To reduce the number of attacks that occur by using the medication regularly on a long-term basis.  
    

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   Glyceryl trinitrate is available in different forms, namely sublingual (under the tongue) tablets, mouth sprays and skin patches.  
    

*   GTN sublingual tablets or mouth spray can be used to relieve angina attacks or to prevent an expected angina attack, e.g. moments before exercising. Symptoms of an angina attack may include one or more of the following:  
    

*   Chest pain/ chest tightness
*   Shortness of breath 
*   May also be accompanied with heavy sweating, or pain that spreads to your jaw, arm or back.  
    

*   The tablet or spray should be used at the first sign of an attack of angina. Do not wait until severe pain occurs. This medication usually provides relief within five minutes. 
*   If you are using GTN to prevent an expected angina attack, you may dissolve a tablet under your tongue if using tablets or administer a spray under the tongue if using spray, five to ten minutes before you participate in an activity that could cause angina, such as exercise.  
    

*   Directions on how to take GTN sublingual tablets:

*   Place a tablet under your tongue when you experience chest pain. Do not swallow the tablet. 
*   If the pain is not relieved after five minutes, use a second tablet. 
*   If the pain is still not relieved after five minutes, use a third tablet. If you still have pain after using the third tablet, seek medical help or call for an ambulance (995) immediately. . 
*   While waiting for the ambulance to arrive, continue placing a tablet under your tongue every five minutes if your pain continues.  
    

*   Directions on how to use GTN mouth spray:

*   Before using GTN mouth spray for the first time, check that the spray is working by pressing the spray button a few times until it produces a fine liquid mist.
*   If you do not need to use GTN mouth spray very often, remember to check the spray regularly to see that it still works properly.
*   Remove the plastic cover, and do NOT shake the plastic bottle.
*   Hold the bottle upright and close to your mouth, and point the nozzle at the area under your tongue. Press the button to deliver one spray under your tongue.
*   Release the button and close your mouth. Avoid swallowing immediately after using the spray, and do NOT inhale the spray.

## What is this medication for?

Tocilizumab is an Interleukin-6 inhibitor (IL-6i). IL-6i belongs to a class of medication called biologics or more specifically, biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs).

Biologics are small molecules that work by blocking certain parts of the immune system that cause inflammation in the body.

IL-6i targets and blocks natural substances called cytokines which causes inflammation in the body. This improves symptoms, reduces flares, slows disease progression and improves quality of life.

It may be used alone or together with other DMARDs.

## How should I take/use this medication?

## What is this medication for?

Dapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. SGLT2 inhibitors work by preventing the kidneys from reabsorbing sugar (glucose) back into the blood, and this increases the amount of sugar that is removed in the urine. It is used in the treatment of diabetes. It works together with lifestyle changes, such as having a healthy diet and regular exercise, to reduce blood sugar levels.  

  

If you suffer from heart failure, this medication can also be given to you to help with your heart condition, even if you do not have diabetes. 

  

If you suffer from certain kidney problems, this medication can also be given to help to lower the risk of worsening kidney problems, even if you do not have diabetes.

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

## What is this medication for?

Secukinumab belongs to a class of medicines called biologics. Biologics are genetically-engineered proteins. Secukinumab works by blocking the activity of a protein called interleukin (IL) 17A. IL-17A levels are increased in diseases such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Secukinumab blocks IL-17A and helps to reduce the activity of the immune system and the symptoms of the diseases.  

It may be used alone or together with other DMARDs.

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   Secukinumab should be injected as prescribed by the doctor.
    
*   Secukinumab is available as a prefilled (ready-to-use) injection. It is given via injection under the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach, thigh or upper outer arm. You and your doctor will decide if you should administer Secukinumab yourself. You or your caregiver should receive training on how to inject Secukinumab from your doctor, pharmacist or specialty nurse prior to attempting the administration on your own. Always remember to rotate the injection site.
    
*   The effect of Secukinumab is not seen immediately. It may take several weeks before you observe an improvement in your condition.

title: What should I know about nitrosamines in my medication? 
url_slug: What-should-I-know-about-nitrosamines-in-my-medication 
keywords: 
```

## I have been informed that my medication contains nitrosamine impurities. What are nitrosamines? 

Nitrosamines are chemical substances that are present in our daily lives. They can be found in low levels in our water and foods, including dairy products such as milk and cheese, processed meat such as sausages, pickled vegetables and salted fish. 

## Why are they found in my medication?

Nitrosamines impurities can be formed in certain medications when the medication is being produced. When nitrosamines are taken below levels that are considered acceptable by healthcare regulatory agencies, it is not expected to cause any harm.

  

## What is the concern of possible nitrosamine impurities in my medication?   

In animal studies, nitrosamine impurities have been found to cause cancer and therefore it has been identified as a potential carcinogen in humans. A carcinogen is a substance that is capable of causing cancer in humans. However, in these studies, the amount of nitrosamine impurities given to the animals were much higher than what we would normally be exposed to. People taking the drugs that contain nitrosamine impurities at, or below the acceptable level every day for 70 years are not expected to have an increased risk of cancer.  

  

## How to know if my medication contains nitrosamines?

The presence of nitrosamine impurities in some medications have only been found out recently. Regulatory authorities regularly review the presence of nitrosamine in medications and whether they are at a level that may cause harm to humans. If nitrosamine impurities are found in the medication, regulatory authorities such as the Singapore Health Sciences Authority(HSA) will advise the healthcare professionals on the appropriate actions required to protect you.

  

If you have any questions about your medication, or want to find out more, please discuss with your healthcare professional.  

  

## My medication may contain nitrosamine impurities, but I am advised to continue taking them. What should I do?  

There are no immediate health risks associated with the use of medication containing low levels of nitrosamine impurities.  Please continue taking the medication as directed by your healthcare professional.   

  

HSA and other health regulatory bodies will decide whether the level of nitrosamines is acceptable and the appropriate actions to be taken. The risk related to taking medications with nitrosamine impurities may depend on several factors such as  

*   The daily dose of the medication  
    
*   The duration of your treatment
*   The level of nitrosamine impurities
*   Whether different treatment choices are available

HSA and other health regulatory bodies will also balance the risk of you continuing to take medications with nitrosamine impurities against the need to make sure you continue to have medications available to treat your condition. 

  

## My medication has been recalled due to the presence of nitrosamine impurities, what should I do?  

If your medication has been recalled, please continue taking your medication until you have been provided with a replacement brand. In some situations, your doctor might choose a different medication to treat you. There is no immediate safety risk to continue taking the medication.   

  

Do not stop taking your medication suddenly as this can possibly be dangerous, and may cause greater harm.

  

## What precautions should I take?

 You should continue taking your medication as directed by your doctor. 

  

If there are nitrosamine impurities found in your medication at unacceptable levels, you will be informed by your healthcare professional.   Your healthcare professional will then advise you on what you need to do and whether there are suitable replacements available.

*   You develop a fever, sore throat or other infections. See a doctor immediately because Leflunomide may reduce your immune response and cause some infections to become more severe. Inform the doctor whom you consult that you are taking Leflunomide. During this period, you may temporarily stop taking Leflunomide for 1-2 weeks until you recover.
    
*   Inform your doctor before any surgeries as Leflunomide may increase the risk of infections after the operation and/or slow down wound healing.
    

Conception and breastfeeding precautions:

*   Reliable contraceptive measures must be used to avoid unplanned pregnancy for women on Leflunomide. Measures that are not reliable include the use of condom and diaphragm and the withdrawal method.
    
*   Women who wish to become pregnant while on Leflunomide or after stopping Leflunomide will need to take another medication, Cholestyramine, to help remove Leflunomide from their body. Without this, pregnancy should be strictly avoided for up to 2 years after stopping Leflunomide. If you suspect that you are pregnant while on Leflunomide, inform your doctor immediately. As Leflunomide may be found in breast milk, women are advised not to breastfeed.
    
*   After taking Cholestyramine, it is recommended for women to avoid becoming pregnant for at least 3 months.
    
*   For men who are considering to have children, the continued use of Leflunomide may be considered. Please discuss with your primary rheumatologist.

## What is this medication for?  

Antihistamines are a group of medications which can be used to relieve symptoms of allergic reactions. Antihistamine eye drops are used to treat symptoms of eye allergies (allergic conjunctivitis), such as red, itchy eyes and watery eyes. They may contain ingredients such as:

*   Ketotifen
*   Olopatadine  
    

## How should I take/use this medication?

Apply this medication to the affected eye once or twice a day as directed by your healthcare professional

  

For proper use of eye drop:

*   Wash your hands with soap and water, and read the instructions on the label
*   Shake the bottle
*   Tilt your head backwards and look up
*   Gently pull the lower eyelid down to form a pocket and squeeze the bottle to apply one drop into your eye. To prevent the tip of the bottle from getting dirty, make sure the tip does not touch the eye or any other surface
*   Close your eyes and press down gently on the inner corner of your eye for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the medicine to be absorbed and prevent it from being drained into the back of your throat
*   If you need to use more than 1 drop of medicine, or if you are using another type of eye drop, wait at least 5 to 10 minutes before applying the next eye drop. This is to prevent the first drop of medicine from being washed away by the second drop of medicine before it has time to work. This also prevents any medicine interactions between different eye drops
*   If your doctor prescribed both eye drops and eye ointments, you should use the eye drops first

For contact lens wearers:

*   Remove your contact lens before each application of medication
*   If you are using hard lens, you can put them on directly after applying the eye drops

## ​What is this medication for?

Terazosin belongs to a group of medications known as alpha-1 blockers. It is used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia, a condition where the prostate gland is enlarged due to a non-cancerous growth and this is caused by overproduction of a hormone called dihydrotestosterone. The prostate is close to the bladder, therefore enlargement of the prostate gland can affect the flow of urine. This leads to urinary symptoms such as a weak or interrupted urine flow, frequent or urgent need to urinate. The medication works by relaxing the muscles of the prostate gland and bladder exit to help relieve these symptoms.  

  

It is also used to reduce high blood pressure in people with hypertension. It works in high blood pressure by widening (relaxing) blood vessel walls thus lowering your blood pressure.

  

This medication may also be used for other conditions. Check with your healthcare professional if you are unsure why you are given this medication.

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.

```

## What is this medication for?

Symbicort inhaler is used to help control symptoms in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a disease affecting the lungs which make it harder for the person to breathe as the disease gets worse.  

  

Symbicort contains two ingredients, Formoterol and Budesonide. Formoterol helps to keep the airways open, making it easier for air to move in and out of the lungs. Budesonide is a type of steroid and helps to reduce and prevent swelling and inflammation in the airways.

  

Symbicort is normally referred to as a ’preventer’ or ‘controller’ inhaler as it helps to prevent symptoms such as breathlessness in asthma and COPD. It can also help to reduce the chances of having an asthma attack. In some cases, the doctor will also ask you to use Symbicort to relieve asthma attacks.

 

## How should I use this medication?

*   Use your Symbicort inhaler regularly as directed. Do not stop using the inhaler without checking with your healthcare professional, even if you feel well or there are no symptoms.

*   Preparing the inhaler before use  
    

**​****Steps**  

**​Description**  

​1  

​Shake the inhaler gently.    

​2  

​For a new inhaler, release  

*   3 puffs into the air, if you are using the 40mcg/2.5mcg inhalation
*   2 puffs into the air, if you are using inhalers of other strengths  
    

​3  

​For inhalers that have not been used for more than a week or have been dropped, release 2 puffs into the air.  

  

*   Administering the medication 

**​Steps**  

​**Description**  

​1  

​Shake the inhaler before use.  

​2  

​Remove the mouthpiece cover.   

​3  

​Hold the inhaler upright in front of your mouth. Breathe out as far as you can and put the mouthpiece in your mouth (between your teeth) and close your lips around it.  

​4  

​Start to breathe in deeply and slowly through your mouth. Press down firmly on the counter to release the medication at the same time.  

​5  

​Remove the inhaler from your mouth. Hold your breath for approximately 10 seconds or for as long as comfortable.  

​6  

​Shake the inhaler then repeat Steps 3 to 5 if another puff is required.  

​7  

​Put the mouthpiece cover back to the original position to prevent dust and debris from accumulating.  

​8  

​Rinse your mouth with water after use  

  

*   Cleaning the inhaler

​Steps  

​Description  

​1  

​Remove the mouthpiece cover.  

​2  

​Wipe the inside and outside of the mouthpiece with a clean, dry cloth.  

​3  

​Replace the mouthpiece cover.  

​4  

​It is recommended to clean the inhaler at least once a week. Do not put the inhaler in water or dismantle the inhaler.  

  

*   Reading the counter

*   The counter helps you to keep track of the number of puffs left in the inhaler.
*   Discard the inhaler when the counter reaches zero as you have used up the inhalations in the inhaler.
*   Your inhaler may not feel empty, and it may still operate but you will not get the right amount of medication if you continue to use it.  
    

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

*   Having to use your ‘reliever’ inhaler more often than before  
    
*   Your wheezing (a high-pitched whistling sound made while breathing) or chest tightness
    
    gets worse

These symptoms may mean that your condition could be getting worse and you may need extra treatment.

```

## What is this medication for?

There are 2 types of emergency contraception to prevent pregnancy; the pill method and the insertion of a device called the copper intrauterine device (IUD). A copper IUD can prevent pregnancy because its presence is toxic to sperms. A woman might use emergency contraception if she forgot to take her birth control pills, if the condom broke or slipped off during sexual intercourse, or if no birth control methods were used.

   

Ella® (ulipristal acetate), also known as “Morning-After Pill”, is one of the pill methods. It is a safe and effective way to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sexual intercourse.  

  

## How should I take/use this medication?  

*   You may take this medication with or without food
*   You may take the medication at any time during the menstrual cycle. 
*   Take one tablet (30mg) as soon as possible, within 120 hours (5 days) of intercourse. 
*    Do not repeat the medication during the same menstrual cycle  due to limited information
*   If you vomit within 3 hours after taking the medicine, take another tablet as a replacement. Consult a doctor to get an additional dose of the medicine.

   
You may still get pregnant if there is sexual intercourse after taking the pill. Use a condom or any other type of birth control method if you have sexual intercourse after taking the emergency contraceptive pill.  

  

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?  

The tablet works best the sooner you take it after having unprotected sex. It can only prevent you from becoming pregnant, if you take it within 5 days of unprotected sex. Please contact your healthcare professional if it is more than 5 days of unprotected sex.

title: Rifampicin
url_slug: Rifampicin
keywords: Rifampicin,
```

## ​What is this medication for?

  

Rifampicin is an antibiotic that is commonly used together with other medications for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB).

  

Tuberculosis is an infection caused by the bacterium _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. You can get infected by breathing in droplets containing this bacterium that are sprayed into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

  

There are two types of tuberculosis: 

  

1.  Active TB  

*   An infection with _M. tuberculosis_ could present with symptoms. It is possible to spread the infection when you have active tuberculosis that is not treated.
*   Common signs and symptoms include coughing for more than three weeks, may be coughing up blood, fever, night sweats, loss of appetite, weight loss, pain in the chest. 
*   Your doctor may do an X-ray of your chest to observe for any unusual signs in your lungs, or a phlegm test to check for the presence of the tuberculosis bacteria under the microscope.
*   Usually treated with a combination of the following four medications: Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Ethambutol and Pyrazinamide. These medications can work together to kill the tuberculosis bacteria.  
    

2\. Latent TB

*   An infection with tuberculosis bacteria but with NO symptoms.
*   If you have latent TB, you cannot spread it to another person
*   Usually treated with either Isoniazid or Rifampicin.  
    

You might have to take the medication for six to nine months. For active tuberculosis, the first two months usually consists of a combination of the four medications stated above, and the remaining four to seven months is completed using the two medications, Rifampicin and Isoniazid. Do not miss any dose of medication. This may lead to a relapse or worsening of tuberculosis, or a condition with a more resistant form of tuberculosis. In such cases, a longer duration of treatment or use of stronger medications may be needed.

  

Depending on your condition, you may need to attend Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) sessions to help you complete your course of treatment. DOT refers to a healthcare worker or trained volunteer supervising the patient taking each dose of tuberculosis medications. The number of DOT sessions can range from once a day to three times a week.  

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.
*   This medication should be taken at least 30 minutes before food, on an empty stomach. However, if you are having stomach discomfort, you can take them after food instead.
*   Take your medications at the same time every day to maintain the same amount of medication in your body.
*   In children, an oral liquid formulation (in-house preparation) may be available. Use a medicine spoon or the graduated syringe provided to measure the medicine. Do not use household spoons as they may not be accurate.   
    

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

*   If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Then take your next dose at the usual time. Do not take two doses to make up for the missed dose.
*   It is important to complete the entire course of medication, even when you start feeling better during the treatment. This ensures that the tuberculosis bacteria in your body is fully killed.  
    

## What precautions should I take?  

Before starting tuberculosis treatment, inform your healthcare professional if: 

*   You are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication
*   You have pre-existing medical conditions such as kidney and/or liver problems, gout
*   You consume alcohol regularly
*   You intend to become pregnant (conceive) or breastfeed while taking this medication
*   You are pregnant or breastfeeding
*   If you have active TB, you should stay at home for the first two weeks of your treatment. This is to prevent spreading the bacteria to others, as you are more likely to be able to infect others during this period. If you have close, regular contact with family members or friends, encourage them to visit a doctor to test for TB.
*   If you need to leave the house, wear a surgical mask in public spaces and avoid crowded places. Avoid close contact with anyone who may have low immunity (including elderly, young children, pregnant women). 
*   After taking at least two weeks of effective treatment, you are generally considered non-infectious, meaning less likely to infect others, provided that you continue with the rest of the treatment.
*   If you have latent TB, seeing a doctor early and receiving treatment can help to prevent your loved ones from getting active TB in the future.

## What are some common side effects of this medication?

Like all medications, this medication may cause some possible side effects but not everyone experiences them. Consult your healthcare professional if any of the side effects becomes severe and bothersome.

  

The common side effects of Glibenclamide include:  

*   Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)

*   If you experience low blood sugar, read below to manage your symptoms 

*   Weight gain

*   Exercise regularly to prevent weight gain associated with this medication

Symptoms of low blood sugar include:

*   Weakness 
*   Dizziness 
*   Hunger 
*   Sweating 
*   Trembling 
*   Blurred vision 
*   Walking unsteadily
*   Fast heartbeat

  

If you experience any of these low blood sugar symptoms, do the following immediately:  

  

Step 1: Check your blood sugar level with a home blood sugar meter (glucometer) if available. If your blood sugar level is less than 4 mmol/L, take 15 grams of fast-acting sugar. Examples of 15 grams of fast-acting sugar include:  

*   3 glucose tablets or 
*   Half a glass of fruit juice (200ml) or
*   Half a can of soft drink or sweetened drink (175ml) or
*   1 can of less sugar soft drink (330ml) or
*   3 teaspoons of sugar, honey or syrup  
    

  

Step 2: Monitor yourself for 15 minutes. If you have a glucometer (home blood sugar meter), check your blood sugar level again after 15 minutes. 

Step 3: If your blood sugar level is still less than 4 mmol/L or you still have symptoms of low blood sugar, you should take another 15 grams of fast-acting sugar as per Step 1.

If your symptoms do not go away, see a doctor or go to the hospital immediately.

Step 4: Take your meal or snack if your blood sugar level is 4 mmol/L and above after consuming the fast-acting sugar earlier on. 

  

Glibenclamide compared to other Sulphonylureas (eg. Glipizide or Gliclazide) has a longer drug action and higher risk for low blood sugar. You may want to discuss with your doctor to switch to a shorter action drug.

url_slug: Isoniazid
keywords: Isoniazid,
```

## What is this medication for?

  

Isoniazid is an antibiotic that is commonly used together with other medications for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB).

  

Tuberculosis is an infection caused by the bacterium _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. You can get infected by breathing in droplets containing this bacterium that are sprayed into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

  

There are two types of tuberculosis: 

  

1.  Active TB  

*   An infection with _M. tuberculosis_ could present with symptoms. It is possible to spread the infection when you have active tuberculosis that is not treated.
*   Common signs and symptoms include coughing for more than three weeks, may be coughing up blood, fever, night sweats, loss of appetite, weight loss, pain in the chest. 
*   Your doctor may do an X-ray of your chest to observe for any unusual signs in your lungs, or a phlegm test to check for the presence of the tuberculosis bacteria under the microscope.
*   Usually treated with a combination of the following four medications: Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Ethambutol and Pyrazinamide. These medications can work together to kill the tuberculosis bacteria.  
    

2\. Latent TB  

*   An infection with tuberculosis bacteria but with NO symptoms.
*   If you have latent TB, you cannot spread it to another person
*   Usually treated with either Isoniazid or Rifampicin.  
    

You might have to take the medication for six to nine months. For active tuberculosis, the first two months usually consists of a combination of the four medications stated above, and the remaining four to seven months is completed using the two medications, Rifampicin and Isoniazid. Do not miss any dose of medication. This may lead to a relapse or worsening of tuberculosis, or a condition with a more resistant form of tuberculosis. In such cases, a longer duration of treatment or use of stronger medications may be needed.

  

Depending on your condition, you may need to attend Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) sessions to help you complete your course of treatment. DOT refers to a healthcare worker or trained volunteer supervising the patient taking each dose of tuberculosis medications. The number of DOT sessions can range from once a day to three times a week.

  

## How should I take/use this medication?  

*   Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.
*   This medication should be taken at least 30 minutes before food, on an empty stomach. However, if you are having stomach discomfort, you can take them after food instead.
*   Take your medications at the same time every day to maintain the same amount of medication in your body.
*   In children, the medication may be made into a mixture with water before taking.   
    

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?  

*   If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Then take your next dose at the usual time. Do not take two doses to make up for the missed dose.
*   It is important to complete the entire course of medication, even when you start feeling better during the treatment. This ensures that the tuberculosis bacteria in your body is fully killed.  
    

## What precautions should I take?  

Before starting TB treatment, inform your healthcare professional if: 

*   You are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication
*   You have pre-existing medical conditions such as kidney and/or liver problems, gout
*   You consume alcohol regularly
*   You intend to become pregnant (conceive) or breastfeed while taking this medication
*   You are pregnant or breastfeeding  
    
*   If you have active TB, you should stay at home for the first two weeks of your treatment. This is to prevent spreading the bacteria to others, as you are more likely to be able to infect others during this period. If you have close, regular contact with family members or friends, encourage them to visit a doctor to test for TB.
*   If you need to leave the house, wear a surgical mask in public spaces and avoid crowded places. Avoid close contact with anyone who may have low immunity (including elderly, young children, pregnant women). 
*   After taking at least two weeks of effective treatment, you are generally considered non-infectious, meaning less likely to infect others, provided that you continue with the rest of the treatment.
*   If you have latent TB, seeing a doctor early and receiving treatment can help to prevent your loved ones from getting active TB in the future.  
    

## What are some common side-effects of this medication?

*   You may experience numbness or tingling sensations on your hands and feet.

*   Continue taking your medication and inform your doctor at your next visit. Your doctor may advise you to take Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) to prevent or lessen this side effect.  
    

## What are some rare but serious side-effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?

If you experience any of these symptoms, you should stop your medication and seek immediate medical attention:

*   Drug allergy symptoms such as swollen face/eyes/lips/tongue, difficulty in breathing, itchy skin rashes over your whole body
*   Signs of liver issues such as dark coloured urine or light coloured stools, nausea and vomiting that does not go away, loss of appetite, stomach pain, yellowing of your eyes or skin
*   Fever, chills, feeling tired or weak (flu-like symptoms)
*   Unexplained bruising or bleeding  
    

There are some tests that are required to better monitor and manage possible side effects from treatment of tuberculosis. These include:  

*   Regular blood tests, especially to monitor your liver function  
    

## What food or medication should I avoid when I take this medication?

*   Avoid alcohol as it may increase the risk of liver problems.
*   It is important that you inform your healthcare provider if you are taking other medications – including those for current medical conditions, chronic medications, oral contraceptives (birth control pills), over-the-counter medications, supplements and traditional/herbal remedies – as they may interact with TB medications.

```

## What is this medication for?

Latanoprost belongs to a class of medications called prostaglandin analogues, which is used to treat glaucoma. Glaucoma is a condition where the nerve in the eye is damaged, and is usually associated with increased eye pressure. Untreated glaucoma can affect your eyesight and cause blindness. Latanoprost helps to lower the pressure in your eye by increasing drainage of fluid in the eye.  

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   Proper use of eye drop

*   Wash your hands with soap and water, and read the instructions on the label.
*   Tilt your head backwards and look up.
*   Gently pull the lower eyelid down to form a pocket and squeeze the bottle to apply one drop into your eye. To prevent the tip of the bottle from getting dirty, make sure the tip does not touch the eye or any other surface.
*   Close your eyes gently and wipe off any excess eye drops around your eyes with a clean tissue.
*   Keep your eyes closed and press down gently on the inner corner of your eye for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the medication to be absorbed.
*   If you need to use more than 1 drop of medication, or if you are using another type of eye drop, wait at least 5 to 10 minutes before applying the next eye drop. This is to prevent the first drop of medication from being washed away by the second drop before it has time to work. This also prevents any medication interactions between different eye drops.
*   If your doctor prescribed both eye drops and eye ointments, you should use the eye drops first. 
*   Click on this link for a step-by-step guide on how to apply eye drops [https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/A-Step-By-Step-Guide-On-How-To-Instil-Eye-Drops](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/A-Step-By-Step-Guide-On-How-To-Instil-Eye-Drops)

title: Salmeterol / Fluticasone Inhaler
url_slug: Salmeterol-Fluticasone-Inhaler
keywords: Seretide,salmeterol,Fluticasone,
```

## What is this medication for?

Seretide inhaler is used to help control symptoms in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a disease affecting the lungs which make it harder for the person to breathe as the disease gets worse.

  

Seretide contains two ingredients, Salmeterol and Fluticasone. Salmeterol helps to keep the airways open, making it easier for air to move in and out of the lungs. Fluticasone is a type of steroid and helps to reduce and prevent swelling and inflammation in the airways. 

  

Seretide is normally referred to as a ‘preventer’ or ‘controller’ inhaler as it helps to prevent symptoms such as breathlessness in asthma and COPD. It can also help to reduce the chances of having an asthma attack.

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   Use your Seretide inhaler every day to control your condition.
*   Do not stop using your inhaler even when you feel well or do not have any symptoms. 
*   Please refer to the Seretide Accuhaler’s or Evohaler’s patient information leaflet to learn how to use the inhaler. 

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Then take your next dose at the usual time. Do not take two doses to make up for the missed dose.

  

## What precautions should I take?

Inform your healthcare professional if: 

*   You are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication
*   You are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding
*   You are taking any other medications, including supplements, traditional medications and herbal remedies 
*   You are taking oral medications to treat fungal infections such as itraconazole or ketoconazole.
*   You have high blood pressure
*   You have heart, liver or thyroid problems
*   You have diabetes
*   You have low blood potassium levels

Seretide will not stop an asthma attack that has already started as it takes a longer time for the medication to work. Thus, you should always carry a fast-acting inhaler, such as Salbutamol inhaler, that would open up your airways quickly to relieve your breathlessness during an asthma attack. Fast-acting inhalers are normally referred to as ‘reliever’ inhalers.

  

Please see your healthcare professional if your asthma symptoms get worse. Signs include:

*   Having to use your ‘reliever’ inhaler more often than before
*   Your wheezing (a high-pitched whistling sound made while breathing) or chest tightness gets worse
*   Your ‘reliever’ inhaler doesn’t help you as well as before

These symptoms may mean that your condition could be getting worse and you may need extra treatment.

  

## What are some common side-effects of this medication?

*   Increase chance of experiencing throat irritation, oral fungal infection (seen as white patches in mouth), hoarseness of voice and coughing. You can prevent these side effects by:

*   Rinsing your mouth with water and spitting the water out after rinsing.
*   Brushing your teeth each time after you use your Seretide inhaler

*   Dizziness
*   Headache

The dizziness and headache may happen but should get better over time. Check with your doctor if any of these symptoms are serious or do not go away.

## What is this medication for?

Finasteride is approved to treat male pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia).

The improvement rate varies from person to person; it usually occurs after the medication has been used for at least 3 months and lasts only as long as the medication continues to be used. Hair loss will begin again within 3 to 6 months after stopping the medication.

url_slug: Sunscreens
keywords:

## What is this medication for?

Excessive exposure to sunlight causes sunburn, premature aging, wrinkling and brown pigmentation. It also increases the risk of skin cancer. In some people, sunlight may induce skin rashes or worsen an existing skin condition. Although your skin has its own natural defense mechanism, it is not enough to prevent the damage caused by ultraviolet radiation.

The so-called healthy tan is actually a response to sun damage. The skin starts to become darker and the outer layers become thicker in an effort to provide a better barrier against the sunrays. However, the harmful rays are still able to penetrate this natural barrier. Additional protection is essential to prevent damage into the deeper layers of your skin.

Sunscreens are creams, lotions, sprays or oils that protect the skin from the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation of the sun by providing a chemical or physical barrier to it.

Chemical sunscreens absorb ultraviolet radiation, preventing it from reaching the deeper layers of the skin. Examples of some common active ingredients are:

*   Cinnamates
    
*   Drometrizole trisiloxane
    
*   Octocrylene
    
*   Oxybenzone
    
*   Avobenzone (butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane)
    
*   Octinoxate
    
*   Salicylates
    
*   Terephthalylidene dicamphor sulfonic acid
    

Physical sunscreens reflect and scatter light, thus preventing the ultraviolet radiation from penetrating the skin. Examples of some common active ingredients include zinc oxide and titanium dioxide.

## How should I take/use this medication?

Sun Protection Factor (SPF) is an index to indicate the degree of protection from ultraviolet B (UVB), the type of ultraviolet radiation that is more likely to cause sunburn. The higher the SPF, the longer the duration of the protection. A sunscreen with **SPF 30 or higher** should be applied frequently to maintain protection.

*   Dry your skin well before applying the sunscreen.
    
*   Apply the sunscreen at least half an hour before going into the sun.
    
*   Apply the sunscreen generously and evenly over the exposed areas of the whole body.
    
*   Wait for the sunscreen to dry before putting on your clothes or makeup.
    
*   With a non-water resistant sunscreen, re-apply after every swim or after heavy perspiration but make sure your skin is dry first.
    
*   With a water resistant sunscreen, re-apply every two hours or re-apply every hour if you have been swimming.
    
*   Use sunscreen even on cloudy or overcast days. The sunrays are as damaging to your skin on hazy days as they are on sunny days.
    
*   Use sunscreen with SPF of 30 or higher during high altitude activities such as skiing and mountain climbing. At high altitudes, there is less atmosphere to absorb the sunrays, so exposure to the sunrays is higher and the risk of your skin burning is higher.
    

## What precautions should I take?

*   Inform your healthcare professional if you are allergic to this sunscreen or any of its ingredients.
    
*   If you have oily or acne-prone skin, avoid greasy formulations of sunscreens.
    
*   Other ways to maximise sun protection include:
    
    *   Avoiding the sun when it is strongest between 11am to 3pm.
        
    *   Wearing protective clothes under the hot sun. Even if you are under the shade on the beach, sunrays can be reflected off the sand and cause a burn on your skin.
        

## What are some common side-effects of this medication?

*   Temporary stinging sensation

## What are some rare but serious side-effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?

    *   Difficulty in breathing

title: Topical Steroids
url_slug: Topical-Steroids
keywords: 
```

## What is this medication for?

Topical steroids are applied to the skin to relieve skin conditions like swelling, redness, inflammation, itch and allergic reactions.

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   Steroid creams and ointments (topical steroids) should only be applied directly to the affected areas of the skin. Follow the instructions on your medicine label for information on how often you should apply the topical steroid.
*   Apply a thin layer to the affected area and stop using when there are no more symptoms. Applying too much topical steroid may increase the risk of getting side effects, while using too little may decrease the effectiveness of the medication. 
*   Do not bandage or cover the area after applying the medicine unless directed by the doctor. Occlusive dressing (airtight covering) may increase the amount of steroid absorbed through the skin and increase the risk of side effects.
*   One fingertip unit (FTU) is the amount of cream or ointment, squeezed out of a tube (with a standard 5 mm nozzle), from the tip of an adult’s index finger to the first crease of that finger. 
*   One FTU (about 0.5 grams) is enough to treat an area of skin two times the size of the adult’s hand. You may use this as a guide to decide the correct amount of cream or ointment to apply on the affected area.
*   A single 15 grams tube of cream or ointment contains about 30 FTUs.

## Introduction

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition in which acid reflux, the back flow of stomach contents into the esophagus (the tube connecting the throat to the stomach), causes distress and/or complications. ​  

## What is Gastroesophag​​eal Reflux Disease (GERD) and what causes it? ​​

Acid reflux is a normal process which occurs in all individuals. However, constant irritation to the lining of the esophagus, with frequent reflux, can give rise to GERD. 

GERD occurs when a circular ring of muscle that connects the lower end of the gut to the stomach is weak and/or relaxed or if the stomach pushes up through a hole in the diaphragm (large flat muscle at the base of the lungs) muscle. The following factors may increase your risk of getting GERD: 

*   Ageing

*   Pregnancy

*   Obesity 

*   Cigarette smoking

*   Over-eating and having a dietary intake of spicy/fatty/tomato-based foods, chocolate, orange juice, caffeinated/carbonated drinks, alcohol, peppermint and onions  

*   Use of certain medications like codeine, nifedipine, salbutamol, prazosin, ibuprofen, iron salts and alendronate

*   Medical conditions like anxiety, depression, peptic ulcer disease and irritable bowel syndrome​  
    

## ​​What are the symptoms?

_​Heartburn_. A burning sensation that rises from the stomach or lower chest towards the neck, commonly occuring after food.  Non-cardiac (not related to the heart) chest pain may also be experienced. 

_Acid regurgitation_. Acidic stomach contents rise into the throat or mouth. 

Other symptoms of GERD include swallowing difficulty, nausea, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, hoarseness, wheezing, teeth erosion and ear infections. ​

​​​  

## What are the treatment options?

A number of medications are available in various forms (tablets, capsules, suspensions) to relieve GERD symptoms that are mild and occur ≤2×/week with minimal impact on quality of life. However, always consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting on any medications.

Antacids and Alginates​​

Antacids neutralise stomach acid while alginates form a barrier to protect the gut from gastric acid. Antacids such as _aluminium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, calcium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate_ in various combinations with or without alginates can be bought over-the-counter and be used if GERD symptoms are ​not predictable. These medications are usually taken after food and before bedtime, not exceeding four times a day. It is to be noted that calcium and aluminium may cause constipation while magnesium may cause diarrhoea.

Some antacids and/or alginates may be used during pregnancy, breastfeeding and in children older than the age of one year.

Histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs)

H2RAs reduce gastric acid production and are available without a prescription at pharmacies, under the advice of a pharmacist. _Cimetidine_ and _famotidine_ (taken once a day) and _ranitidine_ (taken twice a day), 30-60 minutes before a meal may be used if GERD symptoms are predictable e.g. after eating a large meal. Side effects of H2RAs include nausea, diarrhoea, constipation, abdominal pain, headache and dizziness.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)

PPIs like _omeprazole_ and _pantoprazole_ are used to inhibit gastric acid secretion and allow healing of the gut. They can be bought without a prescription at pharmacies, on the advice of a pharmacist.  They are usually given if your symptoms persist despite taking antacids and/or alginates and/or H2RAs for two weeks. PPIs are taken once a day, 30 minutes before food for two weeks. Both PPIs are equally effective for the treatment of GERD but may cause side effects like nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and headache. ​

Others

The following methods may also relieve symptoms of GERD:

*   Elevate the head of the bed by using six to eight inch blocks or foam wedges.

*   Avoid tight fitting clothes around the waist. 

## Do I need to see a doctor?

The vast majority of patients with GERD will not develop serious complications if reflux is adequately treated. However, severe GERD may give rise to complications. Additionally, other conditions may mimic the symptoms of GERD. It is thus important to consult a doctor if you:

*   Experience shortness of breath, hoarseness, wheezing, teeth erosion and ear infections​

*   Have alarm features like pain on swallowing, swallowing difficulty, bleeding, chest pain, vomiting, unintended weight loss, bloody stools and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes)

*   Have GERD symptoms that are moderate or severe, occurring ≥3×/week, with significant impact on quality of life

*   Have heartburn accompanied with fever, headache, nausea or vomiting (especially if the vomit has blood in it)

*   Have heartburn for over three months, with severe or night time heartburn, regardless if you have tried self-treatment or not

*   Are over 40 years old and experiencing GERD symptoms for the first time

*   Have symptoms which persist for more than two weeks despite self-treatment

*   Take more than one course of PPI treatment every four months

*   Are a child in whom the use of antacids are not indicated and/or require the use of H2RAs or PPIs​

## What can I do to prevent recurrence of GERD?​

_Weight management_. Obesity is linked to a 1.5 to 2 times increase in the risk of GERD symptoms. Reaching and maintaining a healthy weight through appropriate exercise regimens and dietary choices is thus recommended.  

_Smoking cessation._ Smoking increases the amount of stomach acid and reduces and/or ​​damages your body's natural defense mechanisms to acid reflux. Smoking cessation is thus recommended for smokers who suffer from persistent heartburn. If smoking cessation is not possible, smokers should at least refrain from smoking immediately after meals. 

_Diet._ Avoid over-eating by eating small frequent meals. Avoid eating within 3 hours of bedtime. Recognise specific foods which trigger your symptoms and avoid them. For infants and young children, thickened feeds may be tried. 

_Posture._ Avoid lying down immediately after meals. For infants and young children, position them upright after feeding for 20 to 30 minutes.  

_Medications._ Certain medications have a direct irritant effect on the gut. Take plenty of liquid if you need to take doxycycline, aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxe​​​n, iron salts, quinidine, potassium chloride, alendronate and risedronate. ​

## Introduction

An average adult shed about 100 strands of hair a day which will not cause noticeable thinning of the hair on the scalp because new hair is growing at the same time.

## What is hair loss and what causes it?

Hair loss occurs when the cycle of hair growth and shedding is disrupted, or when the hair follicle is destroyed and replaced with scar tissue.

Hair loss can be broadly classified into nonscarring or scarring alopecia.

Male pattern and female pattern hair loss, are nonscarring alopecia, are the most common form of hair loss affecting men and women respectively. They are the only forms that can be self-treated.

Family history and hormone abnormalities (e.g. dihydrotestosterone) are some of the causes of male pattern and female pattern hair loss. Use of certain medications (e.g. b-blockers, ibuprofen) and underlying medical problems (e.g. hypothyroidism) may also contribute to hair loss.

## What are the symptoms?

There is a gradual thinning of hair with no signs of redness, inflammation or scarring on the scalp.

## What are the treatment options?

### Topical Treatment

Topical solution, lotion or foam containing Minoxidil are applied to the affected area of the scalp. Minoxidil works by increasing blood flow to the hair follicles and stimulates them to increase hair growth and slow balding.

You can obtain topical treatment of Minoxidil without a prescription at pharmacies. Some reported side effects of the medicine are itching, dryness, irritation and scaling at the site of application. Consult your pharmacist or doctor if the symptoms persist or become troublesome.

_Note: The rate of new hair growth varies from person to person. Hair growth usually occurs after at least 2 to 4 months with continuous use. Topical Minoxidil is only effective for as long as it is used. Hair loss will occur over a period of 3 to 4 months after Minoxidil treatment is stopped. Hair density will revert back to the level before the medication was started._

### Others

The following methods may also be used to manage hair loss:

*   Wigs or hair weaves to camouflage hair thinning
    
*   Hair gels, sprays, colourants, permanents, etc can be used to provide an appearance of fullness for less severe hair loss
    

## Do I need to see a doctor?  

Only male pattern and female pattern hair loss can be treated with self-medication. Do not assume that all hair loss can be self-treated. Consult a doctor if you:

*   Are under 18 or over 65 years of age
    
*   Are pregnant/breastfeeding
    
*   Are on certain medications e.g. β-blockers, ibuprofen, oral retinoids
    
*   Have no family history of hair loss
    
*   Have sudden and/ or unexplained or patchy hair loss
    
*   Have recently discontinued your oral contraceptives
    
*   Have total baldness or complete loss of all body hair
    
*   Have hair loss related to dietary deficiencies, medical conditions and/or treatment
    
*   Have broken hair shafts that resemble those caused by fungal infection
    
*   Have scalp that is broken, red, inflamed, irritated, infected, painful, scaling or sunburned
    
*   Have recently given birth
    
*   Have changes in nails
    
*   Have loss of eyelashes or eyebrows
    

## What can I do to prevent hair loss?

*   Avoid using oily hair products which may cause folliculitis.
    
*   Avoid tight pulling hair styles.
    
*   Avoid using high temperature from hairdryers and/ or curling / flat irons.

keywords: Nicotine Replacement Therapy,Nicotine Patch,Nicotinell Patch 24h,
```

## What is this medication for?

Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) delivers nicotine without the other harmful chemicals present in cigarette smoke. It reduces the withdrawal symptoms experienced when you are trying to quit smoking, allowing you to focus on the other aspects in your effort to quit smoking.  

  

Nicotinell® Patch releases nicotine slowly over 24 hours, which is absorbed into your bloodstream. This provides your body with nicotine to control baseline nicotine withdrawal symptoms.

  

## How should I use this medication?

Apply a new patch at the same time every day. Remove the backing of the patch and apply onto any hairless, clean and dry area of your chest, back, upper arm, thigh or hip. Hold down for 10 seconds and run your finger around the edges of the patch to ensure proper adhesion.

  

Remove the previous patch before applying a new patch. Fold the used patch into half with the sticky sides together and throw it away. 

  

Apply the patch to a different site each day to reduce skin irritation. After 2 to 3 days, you may apply to a previous spot if there is no sign of irritation. Do not apply patch onto broken skin, red or irritated areas. 

  

## What should I do if I forget to use this medication?

If you miss a dose, apply it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and apply the patch at your usual time. Do not apply two patches to make up for the missed dose.   

  

## What precautions should I take?

You should stop smoking once you start to use NRT. Smoking and using NRT at the same time may increase the risk of adverse effects from the additive effects of nicotine in your body. 

  

If you continue to feel the urge to smoke or experience severe nicotine withdrawal symptoms even after using the NRT patch, please inform your healthcare professional as you may need other types of NRT.

## What is this medication for?

Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) delivers nicotine without the other harmful chemicals present in cigarette smoke. It reduces the withdrawal symptoms experienced when you are trying to quit smoking, allowing you to focus on the other aspects in your effort to quit smoking.  

  

Nicotinell® Lozenge dissolves in the mouth to release a dose of nicotine to reduce your urge to smoke.  

  

## How should I use this medication?

When you feel the urge to smoke, suck one lozenge to release a peppery taste then park the lozenge between your cheek and gum. Resume sucking the lozenge when the taste has faded. Repeat for about 30 minutes until the lozenge completely dissolves. You can suck on one lozenge every 1-2 hours.

  

Do not chew or swallow the lozenge.

  

Do not use more than the recommended maximum number of lozenges as instructed by your healthcare professional or use more than one lozenge each time. 

  

## What precautions should I take?  

You should stop smoking once you start to use NRT. Smoking and using NRT at the same time may increase the risk of adverse effects from the additive effects of nicotine in your body.   

  

If you continue to feel the urge to smoke or experience severe nicotine withdrawal symptoms even after using the NRT lozenges, please inform your healthcare professional as you may need other types of NRT.

## What is Self Care/Medication

Self-care is a broad concept which encompasses any action you take for your physical, mental and emotional health. It can include

*   Treatment for a minor illness with minimal supervision from a healthcare professional
    
*   Taking a healthy, well-balanced diet  
    
*   Exercising regularly  
    
*   Finding appropriate methods to relax after a stressful event
    

Self-care is becoming more popular due to its perceived convenience and the potential to save both time and money.

**Self-medication** is the **safe and responsible** selection and use of medicines by individuals to treat self-recognized illnesses or symptoms.

**Related: [Self-Care Is Important Too](https://www.healthhub.sg/live-healthy/self-care-is-important-too)**

## When Should I Not Self Medicate?

Self-medication should only be practised for minor illnesses. Cases, where you should not self-medicate, include

*   Chronic health conditions such as Asthma or High Blood Pressure. Such patients should have regular follow-ups with their doctor to ensure their condition is under control. These medications may also cause severe side effects if the dose is not carefully adjusted.
    
*   Bacterial infections. Consultation with the doctor is required to ensure that the appropriate medication is chosen, one that is effective and will not cause harm.
    
*   Some populations eg. Infants, Children, Elderly, may be more sensitive to side effects or may require special dosing for their medications. Seeking advice from a healthcare professional is highly recommended.

## What Kinds of Medication can be Obtained for Self Medication

There are 3 classes of medication in Singapore

### Over the Counter (OTC)

These medications can be readily obtained without consulting a doctor or pharmacist. They generally have few side effects and can be safely used, by the average adult, without monitoring from a healthcare professional.

### Pharmacy only (P)

These medications can be obtained without a prescription, but only at a pharmacists counter. Identification must be presented for recording purposes. These medications require more caution but can be safely used with further advice from the pharmacists.

### Prescription only medication (POM)

These medications require a doctor’s prescription. They are either supplied from a clinic/hospital, or you may use a valid prescription to purchase it elsewhere. The conditions they treat usually require close follow up from a doctor. These medications may also have more side effects, or greater risk of adverse drug reaction when not used correctly.

For accurate information about the class of a medication, ask a pharmacist or check the Health Science Authority of Singapore.

## The Patient’s Medication List

Whenever you consult any healthcare professional, it is vital to have an accurate, updated list of medications you are currently taking. This list is known as the Patient’s Medication List (PML).

Not only does this list facilitate communication between the different healthcare professionals you may visit, this list contains vital information for healthcare professionals seeing you for the first time.

A PML should include the following information

*   Two identifiers eg. name and IC
    
*   Chronic medical conditions
    
*   Any drug or food allergies. Description of the allergic reaction
    
*   Medication/supplement/vitamin name (brand name and active ingredient), strength, dosing instructions, and reason for use
    
*   Date last updated
    

Bring the most updated PML with you at every visit to the clinic, hospital or pharmacy and show it the relevant healthcare professional even with seemingly mundane actions such as purchasing vitamins.

## Where Can I Find Out More?

Any further inquiries can be directed to your doctor, or to a community pharmacist.

title: Dutasteride
url_slug: Dutasteride
keywords: Dutasteride,Avodart,Duodart,
```

## ​What is this medication for?

It is used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate), a non-cancerous growth of the prostate gland, caused by overproduction of a hormone called dihydrotestosterone. It lowers dihydrotestosterone, and thus shrinks the prostate and relieves the symptoms. Therefore, this medication is for use in men only. It may take up to 6 months or more for you to notice an effect.    

  

As the prostate enlarges, it can lead to urinary problems such as difficulty in passing urine and frequent visits to the toilet. It can also cause the flow of urine to be slower and weaker. If left untreated, there is a risk that the urine flow may be completely blocked (acute urinary retention) and this requires immediate medical treatment.   

  

Dutasteride can be used alone or with another medication called Tamsulosin to treat enlarged prostate.    

  

This medication may also be used for other conditions. Check with your healthcare professional if you are unsure why you are given this medication.

```

## ​What is this medication for?

It is used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate), a non-cancerous growth of the prostate gland, caused by overproduction of a hormone called dihydrotestosterone. It lowers dihydrotestosterone, and thus shrinks the prostate and relieves the symptoms. Therefore, this medication is for use in men only. It may take up to 6 months or more for you to notice an effect.    

  

As the prostate enlarges, it can lead to urinary problems such as difficulty in passing urine and frequent visits to the toilet. It can also cause the flow of urine to be slower and weaker. If left untreated, there is a risk that the urine flow may be completely blocked (acute urinary retention) and this requires immediate medical treatment.   

  

This medication may also be used for other conditions. Check with your healthcare professional if you are unsure why you are given this medication.

Aspirin (also known as Acetylsalicylic acid) is used to prevent blood clots from forming by making the blood less ‘sticky’. By preventing blood clots, this reduces the risk of you having a heart attack or stroke. 

  

You may be given Aspirin if you have a blockage in your blood vessels or after heart surgery. 

  

Aspirin can also be prescribed after Kawasaki disease (a condition whereby there is inflammation in the blood vessels) for four to six weeks, or longer if your doctor feels that it is necessary due to any abnormalities of the blood vessels that supply the heart with blood, oxygen and nutrients.

  

Aspirin may also be used at higher doses to relieve pain and fever or for anti-inflammatory purposes. Inform your healthcare professional if you wish to consume Aspirin to relieve pain or fever.

  

Aspirin may be started during pregnancy in certain women to prevent the development of pre-eclampsia, a serious condition that usually presents as high blood pressure with or without protein in the urine. Aspirin is normally taken at night for this purpose.

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

## ​What is this medication for?

Fibroids are the most common form of non-cancerous, benign (not harmful) growth in women of reproductive age that grow in the muscles of the uterus (womb). Most of them are very small and do not cause symptoms at all. However, when they become very large, they can cause heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain and discomfort. The causes of uterine fibroids are not yet fully understood, however, they seem to be stimulated by the female hormones.   

  

Esmya® (ulipristal acetate) is used to treat moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids by changing the activity of progesterone. 

  

A single course of Esmya® can be used in women who are about to have surgery for their fibroids. It can be used for more than one course only in women who should not have surgery.

title: Vilanterol / Fluticasone Inhaler
url_slug: Vilanterol-Fluticasone-Inhaler
keywords: Relvar,Fluticasone,vilanterol,Ellipta,
```

## What is this medication for?

Relvar inhaler is used to help control symptoms in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a disease affecting the lungs which make it harder for the person to breathe as the disease gets worse.  

  

Relvar contains two ingredients, Vilanterol and Fluticasone. Vilanterol helps to keep the airways open, making it easier for air to move in and out of the lungs. Fluticasone is a type of steroid and helps to reduce and prevent swelling and inflammation in the airways. 

  

Relvar is normally referred to as a ‘preventer’ or ‘controller’ inhaler as it helps to prevent symptoms such as breathlessness in asthma and COPD. It can also help to reduce the chances of having an asthma attack.

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   Use your Relvar inhaler every day to control your condition.
*   Do not stop using your inhaler even when you feel well or do not have any symptoms. 
*   Please refer to the Relvar Ellipta’s patient information leaflet to learn how to use the inhaler. 

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?  

If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Then take your next dose at the usual time. Do not take two doses to make up for the missed dose.

  

## What precautions should I take?

Inform your healthcare professional if: 

*   You are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication
*   You are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding
*   You are taking any other medications, including supplements, traditional medications and herbal remedies 
*   You are taking oral medications to treat fungal infections such as itraconazole or ketoconazole.
*   You have high blood pressure
*   You have heart, liver or thyroid problems
*   You have diabetes
*   You have low blood potassium levels

Relvar will not stop an asthma attack that has already started as it takes a longer time for the medication to work. Thus, you should always carry a fast-acting inhaler, such as Salbutamol inhaler, that would open up your airways quickly to relieve your breathlessness during an asthma attack. Fast-acting inhalers are normally referred to as ‘reliever’ inhalers.

  

Please see your healthcare professional if your asthma symptoms get worse. Signs include:

*   Having to use your ‘reliever’ inhaler more often than before
*   Your wheezing (a high-pitched whistling sound made while breathing) or chest tightness gets worse
*   Your ‘reliever’ inhaler doesn’t help you as well as before

These symptoms may mean that your condition could be getting worse and you may need extra treatment.

  

## What are some common side-effects of this medication?

*   Increase chance of experiencing throat irritation, oral fungal infection (seen as white patches in mouth), hoarseness of voice and coughing. You can prevent these side effects by: 

*   Rinsing your mouth with water and spitting the water out after rinsing.
*   Brushing your teeth each time after you use your Relvar inhaler

url_slug: Formoterol-Fluticasone-Inhaler
keywords: Flutiform,formoterol,Fluticasone,
```

## What is this medication for?

Flutiform inhaler is used to help control symptoms in asthma.  

  

Flutiform contains two ingredients, Formoterol and Fluticasone. Formoterol helps to keep the airways open, making it easier for air to move in and out of the lungs. Fluticasone is a steroid and helps to reduce and prevent swelling and inflammation in the airways. 

  

Flutiform is normally referred to as a ‘preventer’ or ‘controller’ inhaler as it helps to prevent symptoms such as breathlessness in asthma. It can also help to reduce the chances of having an asthma attack.

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   Use your Flutiform inhaler every day to control your condition.
*   Do not stop using your inhaler even when you feel well or do not have any symptoms. 
*   Please refer to the Flutiform inhaler’s patient information leaflet to learn how to use the inhaler. 

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Then take your next dose at the usual time. Do not take two doses to make up for the missed dose.

  

## What precautions should I take?

Inform your healthcare professional if: 

*   You are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication
*   You are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding
*   You are taking any other medications, including supplements, traditional medications and herbal remedies 
*   You are taking oral medications to treat fungal infections such as itraconazole or ketoconazole.
*   You have high blood pressure
*   You have heart, liver or thyroid problems
*   You have diabetes
*   You have low blood potassium levels

Flutiform will not stop an asthma attack that has already started as it takes a longer time for the medication to work. Thus, you should always carry a fast-acting inhaler, such as Salbutamol inhaler, that would open up your airways quickly to relieve your breathlessness during an asthma attack. Fast-acting inhalers are normally referred to as ‘reliever’ inhalers.

  

Please see your healthcare professional if your asthma symptoms get worse. Signs include:

*   Having to use your ‘reliever’ inhaler more often than before
*   Your wheezing (a high-pitched whistling sound made while breathing) or chest tightness gets worse
*   Your ‘reliever’ inhaler doesn’t help you as well as before

These symptoms may mean that your condition could be getting worse and you may need extra treatment.

  

## What are some common side-effects of this medication?

*   Increase chance of experiencing throat irritation, oral fungal infection (seen as white patches in mouth), hoarseness of voice and coughing. You can prevent these side effects by: 

*   Rinsing your mouth with water and spitting the water out after rinsing.
*   Brushing your teeth each time after you use your Flutiform inhaler

*   Dizziness
*   Headache

The dizziness and headache may happen but should get better over time. Check with your doctor if any of these symptoms are serious or do not go away.  

  

## What are some rare but serious side-effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?

The symptoms of a drug allergy include one or more of the following:

## What is this medication for?

Beclomethasone inhaler is a steroid inhaler that helps to reduce and prevent swelling and inflammation in the lungs. Beclomethasone inhaler is normally referred to as ‘controller’ inhaler as it helps to control symptoms such as breathlessness in asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a disease affecting the lungs which make it harder for the person to breathe as the disease gets worse.

## How should I take/use this medication?

*   Use your Beclomethasone inhaler every day to control your condition, unless otherwise informed by your healthcare professional.
*   Please refer to your Beclomethasone inhaler’s patient information leaflet to learn how to use the inhaler. 

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

*   If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Then take your next dose at the usual time. Do not take two doses to make up for the missed dose.

  

## What precautions should I take?

Inform your healthcare professional if: 

*   You are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication
*   You are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding
*   You are taking any other medications, including supplements, traditional medications and herbal remedies. 
*   You are taking oral medications to treat fungal infections such as itraconazole or ketoconazole.

Beclomethasone inhaler will not stop an asthma attack that has already started as it takes a longer time for the medication to work. Thus, you should always carry a fast-acting inhaler, such as Salbutamol inhaler, that would open up your airways quickly to relieve your breathlessness during an asthma attack. Fast-acting inhalers are normally referred to as ‘reliever’ inhalers.

  

Please see your healthcare professional if your asthma symptoms get worse. The signs include:

*   Having to use your ‘reliever’ inhaler more often than before
*   Your wheezing (a high-pitched whistling sound made while breathing) or chest tightness gets worse
*   Your ‘reliever’ inhaler doesn’t help you as well as before

These symptoms may mean that your condition could be getting worse and you may need extra treatment.  
  

## What are some common side-effects of this medication?

*   Increase chance of having throat irritation, oral fungal infection (seen as white patches in mouth), hoarseness of voice and coughing  
    

*   You can prevent these side effects by rinsing your mouth with water and spitting the water out after rinsing, after using your Beclomethasone inhaler.
*   You can brush your teeth each time after you use your Beclomethasone inhaler.
*   Using a spacer device can also reduce these side effects.

*   Increase chance of getting lung infection  
    

## What are some rare but serious side-effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?  

The symptoms of a drug allergy include one or more of the following:

title: Insulin Aspart
url_slug: Insulin-Aspart
keywords: Novorapid,
```

## What is this medication for?

Insulin Aspart is a rapid (fast) acting insulin. It is used to control blood sugar levels after each meal. 

  

## How should I take/use this medication?

Insulin Aspart is usually given immediately or 15 minutes before a meal as an injection into the fatty tissue that is between the skin and muscle layer.

  

Do not forget to eat after injecting Insulin Aspart. If you need to, you can inject immediately or very soon after a meal. 

  

Use the injection technique as advised by your doctor or nurse and as described in the manual. Ensure that your insulin appears clear and colourless before use. 

  

Do not use it if it appears cloudy, grainy or if particles are seen in the vial. 

  

Do not stop your insulin without checking with your doctor.  

  

  

How to select an injection site

Insulin should be injected into the fatty tissue that is between the skin and muscle layer. You should rotate the injection site within the same area to prevent your body from forming lipodystrophy (a small lump or dent in the skin that forms when a person repeatedly injects in the same spot).   

  

Do not inject insulin in the areas that are actively used during exercise.   

  

Your abdomen or stomach area is the best site for injection as it provides the fastest and most consistent absorption of insulin. 

  

  

How to inject insulin

1.  Clean the skin before injecting the insulin. 
2.  Lift a skin fold.
3.  Insert the needle at 90 degrees, right angle to the skin. 
4.  During the injection, inject the insulin by pushing the plunger all the way down slowly with your index finger.

*   If you are using an insulin pen, hold the needle and pen in place for 10 seconds before removing the needle and releasing the pinched skin
*   If you are using the insulin vial and syringe, there is no need to hold the needle in place for 10 seconds 

6.  While removing the needle from your skin, make sure you keep the plunger pushed down. This will ensure you get the full dose. Do not rub or massage the injection site. 
7.  Throw the syringe or pen needle away properly in a container that cannot be punctured.

  

You may refer to [this article](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medications/Insulin-Injection-Technique) for more details on insulin injection techniques.  

  

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

If you missed a dose before your meal, it can be given immediately after your meal.   

  

If you forget to inject your insulin, your blood sugar may get too high, a condition known as hyperglycemia. Check your blood sugar with a home blood sugar meter (glucometer). 

  

If your blood sugar remains high for too long, you might develop diabetic ketoacidosis. This is a complication of diabetes that is caused by an increase in the amount of ketones in your blood or urine, which causes your blood to become more acidic. Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include:

*   Increased urination
*   Feeling thirsty
*   Feeling sick, nauseous or vomiting
*   Feeling drowsy or tired  
    
*   Having abdominal pain
*   Having a flushed face 
*   Sweet fruity smell in your breath

You should see the doctor immediately if you have the above symptoms.

  

## What precautions should I take?

Inform your healthcare professional if you:

*   Are allergic to this medication or any of the other ingredients of this medication
*   Drink alcohol often
*   Are eating less than usual due to sickness/a changed diet as your dosage may need to be changed
*   Are travelling across different time zones. You might need to adjust the number of meals and the dose of your insulin based on where you travel to 
*   Are pregnant or breastfeeding

  

If your doctor has informed you that you need to do a fasting blood test, do not inject insulin until after you have your blood taken and are ready to eat.

  

## What are some common side effects of this medication?

Like all medications, this medication may cause some possible side effects but not everyone experiences them. Consult your healthcare professional if any of the side effects becomes severe and bothersome.

  

This medication may cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Symptoms of low blood sugar include:

*   Weakness   
    
*   Dizziness 
*   Hunger 
*   Sweating 
*   Trembling 
*   Blurred vision 
*   Walking unsteadily 
*   Fast heartbeat 

  

If you experience any of these low blood sugar symptoms, do the following immediately: 

Step 1: Check your blood sugar level with a home blood sugar meter (glucometer) if available. If your blood sugar level is less than 4 mmol/L, take 15 grams of fast-acting sugar. Examples of 15 grams of fast-acting sugar include:

*   3 glucose tablets or   
    
*   Half a glass of fruit juice (200ml) or
*   Half a can of soft drink or sweetened drink (175ml) or
*   1 can of less sugar soft drink (330ml) or
*   3 teaspoons of sugar, honey or syrup

  

Step 2: Monitor yourself for 15 minutes. If you have a glucometer (home blood sugar meter), check your blood sugar level again after 15 minutes. 

  

Step 3: If your blood sugar level is still less than 4 mmol/L or you still have symptoms of low blood sugar, you should take another 15 grams of fast-acting sugar as per Step 1.

  

If your symptoms do not go away, see a doctor or go to the hospital immediately.

  

Step 4: Take your meal or snack if your blood sugar level is 4 mmol/L and above after consuming the fast-acting sugar earlier on. 

Low blood sugar may occur if you:

*   Inject too much insulin
*   Do not eat on time, miss your meals or change your diet
*   Exercise or work too hard just before or after a meal
*   Do not eat well due to an infection or illness (especially diarrhoea or vomiting)
*   Drink alcohol on an empty stomach while injecting insulin
*   Have kidney or liver problems which have worsened 

Some patients may also experience mild pain, redness, bruising, swelling, a small lump or dent of the skin at the injection site.   

*   Do not reuse your needles, rotate injection sites within the recommended areas and use shorter needles (4mm or 6mm) to reduce the chances of developing such reactions. 
*   They also usually go away in a few days to a few weeks. 
*   See a doctor if you frequently experience this. Your injection technique may need to be reviewed. 

##   
What are some rare but serious side effects that I need to seek medical advice immediately?  

See a doctor or go to the hospital immediately if your blood sugar level is always low (less than 4 mmol/L) or you continue to experience symptoms of low blood sugar even after taking some sugar (see instructions above for management of low blood sugar).

SGLT2 inhibitors work by preventing the kidneys from reabsorbing sugar (glucose) back into the blood, and this increases the amount of sugar that is removed in the urine. It is used in the treatment of diabetes. It works together with lifestyle changes, such as having a healthy diet and regular exercise, to reduce blood sugar levels. 

  
 

If you suffer from heart failure, this medication can also be given to you to help with your heart condition, even if you do not have diabetes. 

  
 

If you suffer from certain kidney problems, this medication can also be given to help to lower the risk of worsening kidney problems, even if you do not have diabetes.

  
 

## How should I take/use this medication?

Follow the instructions on your medication label and take the medication as prescribed by your doctor. It is usually taken once a day. You may take this medication before or after food. 

  
 

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

If you missed a dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. Then take your next dose at the usual time. 

  
 

If it is less than 12 hours until your next dose, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time. 

  
 

Do not double your dose or use extra medication to make up for the missed dose.

url_slug: Ambroxol-Tablets 
keywords: Ambroxol,
```

## ​What is this medication used for

Ambroxol is used for conditions where there are a lot of thick mucus in the airway passages.  Ambroxol  belongs to a group of medications called mucolytics. Ambroxol works by thinning down the mucus in the airway passages, thus making the mucus less sticky and it also facilitates the removal of the mucus from the airways.

## Dosage and How to Use

Adults and children above 12 years

The recommended dose is 30mg (one tablet) to be taken three times a day. The tablets may be taken with or without food.

## Side Effects, Precautions, Contraindication

### Before you use this medication

Medical advice should be sought before use if you have any of the following conditions or symptoms:

Symptoms indicative of pneumonia or other lung infections (e.g. breathing difficulty while resting, yellow or green thick mucus, blood-stained mucus, high grade fever with temperature more than 38°C, chest pain), having low immune system due to other health conditions (e.g. HIV) or medications (e.g. chemotherapy, immune system medication) or existing lung conditions such as COLD (chronic obstructive lung disorder) or severe uncontrolled asthma.

Do inform your healthcare professionals if you have severe gastric ulceration, liver or kidney problems.

This medication should be avoided if you have a known history of allergy to ambroxol or bromhexine, or any of the other listed ingredients in the product. Some ambroxol tablets may contain lactose as an inactive ingredient, hence it is not recommended to be taken by individuals having hereditary galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency (enzyme to digest lactose) or problems with galactose absorption.

​Ambroxol is not advisable to taken during the first trimester of pregnancy. As ambroxol is excreted in breast milk, it is not recommended to be taken while breastfeeding. Please seek your doctor's or pharmacist's advice before using this medication if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.

### Interactions with other medications

Be sure to inform your doctor and/or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or plan to take other medications, nutritional supplements or herbal products.

​There are currently no known serious interactions where concomitant use should be avoided. However, do alert your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any antibiotics as ambroxol may increase the amount of antibiotic penetration.

### Side effects

Common side effects: nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea, indigestion, heartburn or bloatedness, abdominal pain, dry mouth or dry throat

## Handling and Storage​

Keep out of reach and sight of children.

## Test update 10:35 20230123What is this medication for?

Tetracyclines is a class of antibiotics that is used to treat or prevent infections caused by certain bacteria.

They are also used for the treatment of acne by suppressing the growth of the acne bacteria and decreasing the inflammation caused by the bacteria.

Examples of tetracyclines include:

Doxycycline

Minocycline

Tetracycline

## How should I take/use this medication?

Doxycycline or Minocycline: Take with or after food.

Tetracycline: Take 1 hour before or 2 hours after food for better absorption. However, if it upsets your stomach, you can take it with some food.

Take these medications with a glass of water to prevent irritation of the oesophagus (gullet).

Avoid lying down for at least 30 minutes after ingestion.

Complete the course of antibiotics even if you feel better as incomplete treatment might cause the infection to return or cause antibiotic resistance. When antibiotic resistance happens, the antibiotic will not be able to control the growth of the bacteria anymore. Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional.

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Then take your next dose at the usual time. Do not take two doses to make up for the missed dose.

In the treatment of acne, these medications may be given for about 2 to 6 months.  
 

## What are some common side-effects of this medication?  
 

Some common side effects include:

*   Nausea, vomiting, stomachache or “wind” in the stomach
    *   Taking the medication with some food may reduce these symptoms.

## What is this medication for?

Aciclovir cream is used for the treatment of mild herpes simplex infections of the lips (cold sores) and the skin.

Aciclovir works by stopping the growth of the _Herpes simplex_ virus (HSV) that causes cold sores. While aciclovir cream does not prevent cold sores from coming back, it can reduce the severity and duration of the cold sore symptoms when they appear.

Symptoms of cold sores often include itching, burning or tingling before blisters appear. The blisters may merge and burst before crusting over. The HSV is able to infect other parts of the body or can spread to others, via direct contact with the cold sores or contaminated items (e.g. towels, eating and drinking utensils). The HSV can also be sexually transmitted.

## How should I use this medication?

Wash and dry hands before and after use to prevent the spread of infection

Apply aciclovir cream on the blisters. It is best to apply when the first signs of a cold sore appear (e.g. itching, tingling)

Apply a thin layer to the affected areas 5 times a day, approximately every 4 hours. You do not need to apply the cream when you are asleep

Continue application for at least 5 days, or up to 10 days if the cold sores have not healed

For cold sores on the lips, apply aciclovir cream after eating or drinking to minimize accidental swallowing of the medication

## What should I do if I forget to use this medication?

## What is this medication for?

Isosorbide Dinitrate (ISDN) belongs to a class of medications called Nitrates. Nitrates are used to prevent and treat the symptoms of angina (chest pain). Angina is caused by lack of blood supply and oxygen to your heart. Nitrates work by relaxing blood vessels so that more blood and oxygen is supplied to the heart.

  

When you take this medication regularly on a long-term basis, it can help to treat angina by reducing the number of heart attacks that occur.

  

Nitrates can also be used with other medications for the treatment of heart failure, a condition where the heart is weak and is unable to pump enough blood to the rest of the body.  

  

## How should I take/use this medication?  

*   Do not stop taking your medication without checking with your healthcare professional. Stopping your medication suddenly may cause angina attacks. Ask your doctor for recommendations on how to reduce the dose slowly before stopping completely.
*   This medication should be taken before food, on an empty stomach.
*   This medication is used to reduce the number of angina attacks that occur. They should not be used for immediate relief for chest pain.  
    

## What should I do if I forget to take/use this medication?

If you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, take only the usual dose. Do not double your dose or use extra medication to make up for the missed dose.

## What are some common side-effects of this medication?  

Side effects may include:

*   Dizziness, lightheadedness or faintness

*   This may occur especially when you get up quickly from lying or sitting down. Getting up slowly or changing posture slowly may help. Take a rest by sitting or lying down if you feel dizzy.
*   This is also more likely to happen if you drink alcohol, stand for a long period of time, exercise or when the weather is hot. Do limit the amount of alcohol you drink while you are on Nitrates. Do take extra care during exercise, when the weather is hot or if you need to stand for long periods of time.

*   Temporary headache

*   This is a common side effect that will go away after taking the medication for a while. You may choose to take painkillers such as Paracetamol at the start of using Nitrates, to relieve the temporary headaches. Consult your healthcare professional if the headaches do not go away or become worse.

*   Flushing or redness of the skin
*   Fast heartbeat
